Never share the commission rate until Acme Trading Co asks specifically what the commission rate is. Taylor is not authorized to negotiate the commission rate to a number below 15%. \n\nAlternatively, suppliers can sign up for a full Reposite membership for $500. It gives unlimited leads for a full year and waives all commissions.
