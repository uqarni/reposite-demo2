  Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
  I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
  Can you help me with next steps? 
  Cheers,

"I'm not. The person you want to contact for group reservations is Jason Yelton (jason@dbrparkcity.com).
  
 

  He has all the information you'll need for available sections, group sizes, F&B minimums, menu options, etc.
  
 

  Looking forward to working with you, though!

 We only fly 4 to 5 passengers plus the pilot. We specialize in smaller and more personal groups. If you’re looking to fly large groups, call Arizona Balloons.

"Hi {agent_name}, 
 

 Yes, I can help you with group events! Which date are you looking for, and for how many people? What type of event are you looking for? 
 

 Please keep in mind we are not a regular restaurant that accepts dinner reservations; you must book a private event to have the club open past 7:30pm Tuesday-Friday, or any day outside of that.

"Hi Taylor
Is there a cost to us that we need to pay you for the lead? 
We are not familiar with your company nor do we have a profile on there.
We are open to add for more leads the set up and training time is just the issue.
Any help would be appreciated"

"User:
Hello {agent_name},

Thanks for your interest in the {supplier_name}. With parties of {group_size} we do require a banquet agreement. A banquet agreement is just a limited menu. With your party being {group_size} you would only be able to have one entrée choice for everyone. Here is our banquet menu for you to look over. Everyone would get a salad with our house dressing, Creamy pesto. We also make sure every table has a loaf of bread. Once everyone is done with their meals we pass out our signature ice cream, Spumoni. This is not a confirmed reservation until I have your entrée selection. As to drinks did you want us to include just soft drinks + water or any coffee/tea/milk, iced tea, or beer/liquor/wine?

We don’t offer any private rooms so this wouldn’t be a private event. Everything would be on one check with an added 20% gratuity. If you have any questions please let me know.

Talk soon,
{lead_first_name}

"User:
Hi {agent_name} - great to connect with you. 

I’m a bit confused as I’m not sure what you mean by the “event planner” is that a person or the program Reposite you are talking about. 

Did you reach out to book an event or are you interested in having a sales meeting about this program? 
If it’s about the program, I think we’d like to learn a bit more before signing up although we appreciate the free admission and all the information you shared!"
"User:
{agent_name}, 

We already had an account with Reposite.  It was owned by a prior employee Mel Masi.  I have reclaimed the account and update the notifications (but cannot find where to update the ""owner"" of the account. "
"User:
Hello  {agent_name},

I did receive another email from ‘Reposite’ earlier today and I am not interested. I would rather not sign up for a program, I am already using a platform for private dining that is working just fine for us. If your client would like to gather more information on our program and check availability, they are more than welcome to reach me via email, my cell number below, or they can go to MatthewsRestaurant.com and fill out the inquiry form on the private dining section of the website. That form will also come directly to me 😊 Thank you for your call.

Thank You,
