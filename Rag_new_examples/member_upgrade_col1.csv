  Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
  I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
  Can you help me with next steps? 
  Cheers,

  Thank you for reaching out, yes this is the best email to reach us at! I sent information back to the client but I am waiting to hear back from them still. I met with Brenden and Anand from your team the other day and they got me all caught up on your platform!

"I'm not. The person you want to contact for group reservations is Jason Yelton (jason@dbrparkcity.com).
  
 

  He has all the information you'll need for available sections, group sizes, F&B minimums, menu options, etc.
  
 

  Looking forward to working with you, though!

  My colleague forwards this information to my attention. We don’t see to have an account at Reposi.

 Yes I'm very much that person indeed! I've been dealing with some personal family issues as of late that have finally come to rest.  
 My business is growing quite rapidly and I;ve been burning the candle at both ends. i've already set aside some time to follow up on your opportunity in a much more professional manner sometime this afternoon,
