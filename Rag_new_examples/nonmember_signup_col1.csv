"Hi {agent_name},
  Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
  My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.
  
 Thanks, {lead_first_name}"
"Good Morning {agent_name}, Can this be made within monthly payments? Can you please explain how your platform works?"
"Hello {agent_name},
  At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.
  Would you happen to know if you have any training courses? At the same time, I was wondering how I could get a receipt for the last charge I placed on my credit Card.
  Cheers,
  {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}"
"Good morning {agent_name},
  
 

  In order to quote please provide the following information:
  What date would be your activity?
  Time of the activity.
  Duration of the activity.
  Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
  I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.
  
 

  Best,

  Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
  I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
  Can you help me with next steps?

  Thanks, yes I am the correct contact for group reservations. 
  I was concerned about your quote email from 9/20/23 .... worried it was spam and did not want to click on links. 
  
 

  I tried calling the phone # of Anand 646 688-0433 and have left messages. 
  
 

  Please text me at 435 649-1674 and will call you right back.

"Good morning {agent_name}, yes is very relevant to my business , can you help me and let me know how this works with Reposite?"
"I'm not. The person you want to contact for group reservations is Jason Yelton (jason@dbrparkcity.com).
  
 

  He has all the information you'll need for available sections, group sizes, F&B minimums, menu options, etc.
  
 

  Looking forward to working with you, though!

 Yes I'm very much that person indeed! I've been dealing with some personal family issues as of late that have finally come to rest.  
 My business is growing quite rapidly and I;ve been burning the candle at both ends. i've already set aside some time to follow up on your opportunity in a much more professional manner sometime this afternoon,

"Hi {agent_name},
 Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your warm words regarding our presence on Reposite and the opportunity with {reseller_org_name}.
 

 To provide some insight into our ideal type of group business, we have a strong track record of successfully working with a diverse range of clients, including students, wedding groups, and international groups. We pride ourselves on delivering exceptional experiences tailored to each client's unique needs.
 

 I'd also like to highlight that we have our own fleet of buses, which allows us to ensure top-notch transportation services for our clients. Furthermore, we hold permits for exclusive experiences, such as the bioluminescent bay night kayaking tour, access to El Yunque National Forest, and meet-and-greet services inside the airport terminal. It's important to note that we don't subcontract our services because we are the direct providers, which enables us to maintain strict quality control and a seamless customer experience.
 

 We look forward to exploring potential opportunities on Reposite.
 

 Best regards, 
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}"
"Hello {agent_name},  
 I do have a few more questions. 
 How many caterings do you have in my area? In my case, we cover all the city, not just the neighborhood of {destination}, does this changes the price? Is there any kind of security that I will receive at least my investment back in the first year? 
 Thanks 
 {lead_first_name}"
"Hello
 We only fly 4 to 5 passengers plus the pilot. We specialize in smaller and more personal groups. If you’re looking to fly large groups, call Arizona Balloons.
 Thank you
 {lead_first_name}"
"Hi {agent_name}, 
 

 Yes, I can help you with group events! Which date are you looking for, and for how many people? What type of event are you looking for? 
 

 Please keep in mind we are not a regular restaurant that accepts dinner reservations; you must book a private event to have the club open past 7:30pm Tuesday-Friday, or any day outside of that. 
 

 Best, 
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}"
"Hi {agent_name},  
 we really don't work with any group planners as we can only host six guests for overnight and fourteen for the day trips. We get our business mostly directly through our website and only here and there from agents and some last minute requests from local tour operators. 
 So I am really curious how this could work to our advantage. We would like to extend our advertising in the US and are currently researching what are the most efficient ways to do that. 
 

 Best regards

"Hello {agent_name},
 

 I am afraid we can not supply your request as we have the intuition that what your company wants is us to be registered in your business. I am sorry to inform you that we do not join any unknown business like yours. 
 

 If you want to hire our services please provide the details of your request and we will respond with a quote.
 

 Thank you"
"Dear {agent_name},
 

 

 Unfortunally the restaurant Cañete doesn't have the capacity to receive a table for that amount of people. Cañete belongs to a restaurant group called Olivé in which there are other restaurants with a similar gastronomic offer in which it does have the capacity for groups.
 

 We leave the link below:
 

 

 Grup Olivé
 

 Sorry for the inconveniences.

"Great, I signed up for a time slot on Friday at 9:15am."
"Me again! So I understand correctly using the below rfp as an example.
 

  
 

 Elite Visionary Consulting is requesting a commissionable rate. This means we would pay Elite a commission as well as paying Reposite’s 15% commission, correct?
 

  
 

 Looking forward to any confirmation you can provide,"
