Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here.

Someone from your team created an account on Reposite (don’t worry it could have been a while ago or an old colleague,  happens all the time). 

The quote request came from {reseller_org_name}  - they're looking for a {category} for a group of {group_size} in {destination} in {trip_dates}. You shouls be able to view the request and respond via email but if not by logging into your account <a href={login_link}> here </a>. 

At the moment, you are on our Basic Plan, which requires no upfront cost. I recommend upgrading to our membership plan to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers. You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a 15% commission.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Happy to provide some additional context. At some point either you or one of your team members signed up on Reposite to respond to a quote request from one of our planner partners. Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought-after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to thousands of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. 

In this instance one of our planners, {reseller_org_name}, is actively planning a trip in {destination} for {trip_dates} and thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote. You can log in to respond directly to them <a href={login_link}> here </a>.

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership.

Hey {lead_first_name},

I saw that your Reposite profile just sparked some new interest! A planner {reseller_org_name} just sent you a new quote request - they're looking for {category} suppliers in {destination}.

Based on the details, do you feel like this lead is relevant for {supplier_name}?

Cheers,

Hi {agent_name},

Sure we can get to that by the end of this week. Can you remind me again what your company does and how much it costs?

 Do you want to reach out and see what he would like. 
 Thank you!

Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Thank you for letting me know about the update. I'll ensure all future group business leads come to you directly. Also, thanks for pointing out the issue about only seeing an old 2022 lead on our platform - looks like the newest request wasn't connecting with your existing account, so I'll flag this to my team and make sure that it appears in your quotes dashboard. 
 
It's free to sign up for our basic plan. However, suppliers that are on our full membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses plus all commissions from successful bookings are waived for members as well (Full list of membership benefits are <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .) The 24 hour lead time is valuable, since statistically over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Definitely worth considering if you wanted to get serious about growing a pipeline of group business from travel and event planners.

Are you currently leveraging any platforms or tools to drive more consistent group business your way?

Best,

 All leads should flow to me not Edita. I handle all group business. 
 Also, when I log on your platform, I only see an old 2022 lead. Nothing current.
