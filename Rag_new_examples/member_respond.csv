 Great to connect with you!  One of the planners we work with {reseller_org_name} is sourcing for their group in {destination} for {group_size} people.

 You can reset your password from <a href={login_link}> here </a>. Unfortunately, the only way to communicate directly with the planner and be considered for the group would be through the platform. 
 

 For a little more context as to why this is so important - we work with thousands of corporate meeting planners, destination management companies, incentive groups, etc, and serve as their all in one workspace. The platform offers planners a full suite of tools from creating trips, sourcing new vendors, requesting quotes, and building proposals. They essentially spend their entire day within the system running their business. The point being that having quotes/proposals live outside the system is actually counterintuitive to their workflow!
 

 In addition to that the great part is that once you are all set up you can actually reply to the new leads directly from your inbox since we integrate with your email, so you don't have to login each time a new request is sent your way.

 Yes, of course we can remove you from the platform. I understand that it might be a new way of operating for {supplier_name} but there’s definitely a ton of opportunity to connect with planners like {reseller_org_name} who work with a lot of groups each year.
 Considering you already have an account, would it be worth responding to this one and potentially earning the booking before making a decision to remove your account?

 Assistant:
 

 Hey {lead_first_name},
 

 At the moment, you are on our free Basic Plan. On the basic plan lead generation isn't included, so if you'd like to get more requests or connect with our expansive network of planners I recommend upgrading to our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a>. Beyond just inbound requests, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.
 
If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain your free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers (i.e. the Marketplace and the Discover tool). You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request, as was the case in this instance.

More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

Hello {agent_name},

Thanks for your interest in the {supplier_name}. With parties of {group_size} we do require a banquet agreement. A banquet agreement is just a limited menu. With your party being {group_size} you would only be able to have one entrée choice for everyone. Here is our banquet menu for you to look over. Everyone would get a salad with our house dressing, Creamy pesto. We also make sure every table has a loaf of bread. Once everyone is done with their meals we pass out our signature ice cream, Spumoni. This is not a confirmed reservation until I have your entrée selection. As to drinks did you want us to include just soft drinks + water or any coffee/tea/milk, iced tea, or beer/liquor/wine?

We don’t offer any private rooms so this wouldn’t be a private event. Everything would be on one check with an added 20% gratuity. If you have any questions please let me know.

Talk soon,

 Hey {lead_first_name} -

Thanks so much for getting back to me and sending this information over,  I think {reseller_org_name} would love to see this.

I'd actually love to connect you directly with them as they will be your best point of contact, and are making all the end decisions for this group! They are using Reposite as their all in one workspace to help them plan, source for, and manage all their upcoming events and trips, so they are looking for this quote to come through the system- just to keep communication all in one place. 

Just claim your account <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> and after inputting your basic information, the request will be in your quotes dashboard. 

We've helped brands like the Hard Rock, Rosa Mexicano, Topgolf, Standard Hotels, Carmine's, STK, Pinstripes, Live Nation and more connect with professional planners who book large meetings, corporate outings, and leisure group itineraries. On the planner side of the platform we work with brands like ConferenceDirect, Global Travel Collection, Meetings Made Easy, Amex Global Business Travel, and more to streamline the group planning process from A to Z. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you run into any issues creating your account!

Hi {lead_first_name},

No problem at all, we thought that you might be interested in working with one of our planner partners so we wanted to reach out and give you that opportunity.

To provide a little more context - Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought-after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to hundreds of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. In this instance one of our planners is actively planning a trip, thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote.

There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. Through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships and there is no additional fees or commission.

You can view all of the quote details and respond by registering using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> or check out our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a>! 

Sounds like this isn't a good fit but just figured it was worth giving you all the information, best of luck!
