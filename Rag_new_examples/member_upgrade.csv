 Hi {agent_name}, this is {lead_first_name}. What are the details of this request?
 

 Assistant:
 Hi {lead_first_name},
  
 Great to connect! Happy to help provide some clarity here. One of the planners we work with, {reseller_org_name}, is using Reposite to source for suppliers for their event in {destination} for {group_size} people. Your profile is a match for their group and the planner needs more options so this request was sent directly to you. You can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by logging back into your account <a href={login_link}> here </a>. 
 

 Also, {supplier_name} is currently on our Basic Plan but with our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> you gain access to all relevant RFPs sent directly to your email inbox, unlimited connections via the Discover Tool for outbound prospecting, priority response times, and more. The membership is just {price} per year with no additional fees or commissions and you can learn more <a href={membership_link}> here </a>.
 

 If you’d like to set up a time to discuss further, please book at time on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

 I can definitely help provide some clarity here. {supplier_name} has a profile on Reposite with {email} signed up as the active user. It's possible it has been a while since the account was created so please let me know if there needs to be another email receiving inbound lead notifications!

You currently have an account on our free basic plan. Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a  commission.
 
However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more bookings, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners to make connections that lead to long-term partnerships and repeat bookings. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a> and check out this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform.

 You can reset your password from <a href={login_link}> here </a>. Unfortunately, the only way to communicate directly with the planner and be considered for the group would be through the platform. 
 

 For a little more context as to why this is so important - we work with thousands of corporate meeting planners, destination management companies, incentive groups, etc, and serve as their all in one workspace. The platform offers planners a full suite of tools from creating trips, sourcing new vendors, requesting quotes, and building proposals. They essentially spend their entire day within the system running their business. The point being that having quotes/proposals live outside the system is actually counterintuitive to their workflow.
 

 In addition to that, the great part is that once you are all set up you can actually reply to the new leads directly from your inbox since we integrate with your email, so you don't have to login each time a new request is sent your way.

 Hey {lead_first_name},
 

 I saw that your Reposite profile just sparked some new interest! A planner {reseller_org_name} just sent you a new quote request - they're looking for {category} suppliers in {destination}.

 Yes, this lead is relevant. Thanks for the reminder {agent_name}. We’ll get to it when we can.

 Hey {lead_first_name},
 

 Thanks for getting back to me!
 Glad to hear that you are available and able to get a quote back to {reseller_org_name}. Totally understand you are busy, I'm only reaching out because the data shows that booking conversion increases by 50% when responses are sent within the first 24 hours so I wanted to make sure you have an opportunity to secure this business and get the most out of your Reposite experience! 
 

 At the moment, you are on our Basic Plan which requires no upfront cost. I recommend upgrading to our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.
 

 If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers (i.e. the Marketplace and the Discover tool). You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a commission.
 

 If you’d like to set up a time to discuss further, you can reply with your availability or book at time on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

 Happy to provide some additional context. At some point, {email} created an account for {supplier_name} on Reposite but it may have been a while ago! Reposite is a marketplace connecting professional meeting and event planners to suppliers like yourself. For the planners, we make it easy for them to find what they need without having to do the research or outreach. For suppliers like you, we give you the opportunity to connect with thousands of professional planners in addition to capitalizing on live leads in your area. 
 
 You are currently on our Basic Plan which allows you to maintain a free profile on the platform but does not give you access to the most beneficial business development tools that we offer.

Assistant: 
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Definitely understand that it might be a new way of operating for {supplier_name} but there’s a ton of opportunity to connect with our network of 3,000+ planners like {reseller_org_name}. 

Considering you already have an account, would it be worth responding to this one and potentially earning the booking?

We also recently were acquired by Cvent who has 125,000 active planners in their network who will all be given access to Reposite. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a> and check out this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform.
