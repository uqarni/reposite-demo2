 Hi {agent_name}, this is {lead_first_name}. What are the details of this request?
 

 Assistant:
 Hi {lead_first_name},
  
 Great to connect! Happy to help provide some clarity here. One of the planners we work with, {reseller_org_name}, is using Reposite to source for suppliers for their event in {destination} for {group_size} people. Your profile is a match for their group and the planner needs more options so this request was sent directly to you. You can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by logging back into your account <a href={login_link}> here </a>. 
 

 Also, {supplier_name} is currently on our Basic Plan but with our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> you gain access to all relevant RFPs sent directly to your email inbox, unlimited connections via the Discover Tool for outbound prospecting, priority response times, and more. The membership is just {price} per year with no additional fees or commissions and you can learn more <a href={membership_link}> here </a>.
 

 If you’d like to set up a time to discuss further, please book at time on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

You currently have an account on our free basic plan. Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace.
 
However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more bookings, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners to make connections that lead to long-term partnerships and repeat bookings.

 You can reset your password from <a href={login_link}> here </a>. Unfortunately, the only way to communicate directly with the planner and be considered for the group would be through the platform. 
 

 For a little more context as to why this is so important - we work with thousands of corporate meeting planners, destination management companies, incentive groups, etc, and serve as their all in one workspace. The platform offers planners a full suite of tools from creating trips, sourcing new vendors, requesting quotes, and building proposals. They essentially spend their entire day within the system running their business. The point being that having quotes/proposals live outside the system is actually counterintuitive to their workflow.
 

 In addition to that, the great part is that once you are all set up you can actually reply to the new leads directly from your inbox since we integrate with your email, so you don't have to login each time a new request is sent your way.

 Glad to hear that you are available and able to get a quote back to {reseller_org_name}. Totally understand you are busy, I'm only reaching out because the data shows that booking conversion increases by 50% when responses are sent within the first 24 hours so I wanted to make sure you have an opportunity to secure this business and get the most out of your Reposite experience! 
 

 At the moment, you are on our Basic Plan which requires no upfront cost. I recommend upgrading to our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.
 

 If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers (i.e. the Marketplace and the Discover tool). You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request.
 

 If you’d like to set up a time to discuss further, you can reply with your availability or book at time on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

 Happy to provide some additional context. At some point, {email} created an account for {supplier_name} on Reposite but it may have been a while ago! Reposite is a marketplace connecting professional meeting and event planners to suppliers like yourself. For the planners, we make it easy for them to find what they need without having to do the research or outreach. For suppliers like you, we give you the opportunity to connect with thousands of professional planners in addition to capitalizing on live leads in your area.

Considering you already have an account, would it be worth responding to this one and potentially earning the booking?

That’s correct, you don’t currently have an account set up to respond to this RFP and that’s why we are reaching out to you for this this opportunity.

Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
  
Reposite helps meeting and event planners, travel agents, tour operators and more discover new suppliers, organize all their itineraries, and put together proposals for their clients. They’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
  
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>. Through our full Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships, you can explore all of our membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a>.

 Hey guys,
 Yes, I handle all inquiries and bookings. We don’t do corporate events. Thanks anyway! xo
 
Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name} -
 
Thanks for the update, I’m not used to hearing that in this industry - do you mind me asking why you have found Corporate groups aren’t a good fit and what types of groups are typical for {supplier_name}?

Reposite is not just a way to book with corporate groups at {supplier_name} but a way to expand your relationships to drive more business your way. We offer the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them! After the first lead, you have the opportunity to choose between our Basic Plan and Membership Plan which are both detailed on our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a>. 

I definitely think it would be worth replying in case  {reseller_org_name} is working with a group more suited to your preferences in the future. You can view the details and respond directly to them <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a>.

 Cheers,
 {agent_name}

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. 
 
 However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a <a href={membership_link}> membership </a>. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a>. 
 
 Are you currently using any other sources or tools to grow your group business?

Assistant: 
Definitely understand your preference to wait for a booking to happen before signing up but I would like to provide some additional insight regarding this approach:
 
 RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners are sent to our members a full 24-48 hours before they are made available to any users on our Basic plan. The data we have shows that responses submitted within those first two days have a much higher likelihood of being booked, and for that reason, are almost always awarded to paying members.

Our Basic plan is meant to showcase the functionality of the platform and expose you to the types of planners and leads on the marketplace. If you think this is a good fit, I would highly recommend upgrading your membership so that you can start receiving more leads like this, networking with planners and actively work on increasing group bookings to your business.
 
If you would like to set up a call to discuss this further, one of my colleagues is available, you can schedule a call on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you . If you decide to move forward with membership, you can purchase the annual subscription <a href={buy_link}> here </a>.

Thanks for the quick response. 

I'm glad you brought up CVENT, we have some super exciting news and are proud to share that we were recently acquired by Cvent, which will allow us to expand our database to 100,000+ planners. They acquired Reposite to expand their sourcing ecosystem by offering their planners direct access to ALL vendors and suppliers needed to deliver events; including restaurants, activities, transportation, unique venues, AV, and more. By combining Reposite’s technology with theirs, Cvent can now truly offer their planners a one stop shop for meetings, events, and group travel.

 Currently, we rely on a mix of tools and resources for sourcing group business, including industry-specific forums, social media platforms, and some partnerships with local event planning associations. However, we're always open to exploring new avenues that can help us expand our reach and enhance our business development efforts.
 I'll review the membership details and discuss it further with my team to make an informed decision. Thanks again for your guidance and support.

Great to hear from you.

We offer all 10 Reposite categories everywhere, within those categories there are a bunch of subtypes as well so that our database of suppliers can cover anything that our planner partners might be looking for. {destination} is no different and Reposite membership is based on market/city not neighborhood within a city so you can list your services for {category} throughout {destination}.

Regarding the number of {category} requests in {destination}, I don’t currently have access to that information as Reposite is an always evolving and growing marketplace. With the addition of Cvent’s database of 125,000 planner partners, we are also expecting a ton of growth in RFP volume so historical data won’t be that relevant moving forward.

You can view all of the quote details and respond by registering using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>.  
 

There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite.

 Unfortunally the restaurant Cañete doesn't have the capacity to receive a table for that amount of people. Cañete belongs to a restaurant group called Olivé in which there are other restaurants with a similar gastronomic offer in which it does have the capacity for groups.
 

 We leave the link below:

 Sorry for the inconveniences.

Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to hear from you. Some of our planners require a commissionable rate for their groups.  However, it is free to sign up and respond to this request as you would be on our basic plan.  

Full membership also comes with many other advantages such as direct access to our database of over 100,000 planners, invites to networking events, and priority response time for inbound requests. 

You can view all the details on our <a href={membership_link}> membership plan </a> and this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform to get a better idea of what Reposite is about.
 
If you would like to schedule a time to  discuss membership further, you can book on the calendar <a href={calendar_link}> link </a> at a time that's convenient for you.
 
Please feel free to reach out if you need more information.
