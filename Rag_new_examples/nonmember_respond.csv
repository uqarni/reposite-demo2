 Hi {agent_name}, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?
 

 Assistant:
 Hi {lead_first_name},
  
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people. We didn't have enough {category} options for {reseller_org_name} within our network so we did a little research, noticed {supplier_name} looked like a great fit, and sent you the group lead directly. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 
 
There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, create your profile,  and respond to this lead within Reposite. (For our basic plan users, there is a commission on all successful bookings.) You can also check out this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform to see everything in action or book a meeting on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> to discuss with the team!

Do you leverage any other tools or platforms to help generate consistent group leads/business?

  So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
  I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money.

I do want to make one important distinction between Reposite and booking platforms like WeddingWire - at Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. 

If you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business.

 Hi there, {lead_first_name}!
 

 Thanks for the quick reply. My apologies for any misunderstanding. Looks like one of the professional planners we work with, {reseller_org_name}, found your details exciting for their upcoming event and used Reposite's platform to send your team a quote request for their {destination} itinerary. You received your quote request because the planner found you suited for their needs.

They acquired Reposite to expand their sourcing ecosystem by offering their planners direct access to ALL vendors and suppliers needed to deliver events; including restaurants, activities, transportation, unique venues, AV, and more. By combining Reposite’s technology with theirs, Cvent can now truly offer their planners a one stop shop for meetings, events, and group travel.

 The first lead from Reposite is 100% complimentary, if you receive a booking, there’s just a 15% commission owed to Reposite. Definitely think it’s worth signing up to respond as it could be a great longterm partnership made by connecting with{reseller_org_name}.

 Hello, 
  We basically work with other companies like below:
  1- You can email us the trip details and we can let you know our availability. 
  2- Then if you would like to proceed, we will input the reservations and sent you confirmation emails and a CC form. 
  3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking after receiving the CC.
  4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
  Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.

 Absolutely, I understand your concern. {reseller_org_name} is interested in booking an event for a group size of {group_size} and it is scheduled for {trip_dates}, in {destination}. They found {supplier_name} through Reposite and wanted to get a quote.
  
For some additional context,, Reposite is a B2B marketplace that connects suppliers like {supplier_name} with a network of professional travel and event planners. Reposite offers the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them.
 
You can view the details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a>. Under Organization Name make sure to enter it as "" {supplier_name} "" this will ensure you are brought directly to the quote request.

Do you think you’d be willing to give this a try?

Hi {lead_first_name},

No problem at all, we thought that you might be interested in working with one of our planner partners so we wanted to reach out and give you that opportunity.

To provide a little more context - Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought-after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to hundreds of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. In this instance one of our planners is actively planning a trip, thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote.

There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. On our basic free plan, there is a commission owed to Reposite for successful bookings but through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived.

You can view all of the quote details and respond by registering using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> or check out our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a>!

Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks so much for getting back to me, yes reseller_org_name} is looking for a {category} for {group_size} people in {destination} on {trip_dates}. 

I'd actually love to connect you directly with them as they will be your best point of contact, and are making all the end decisions for this group! They are using Reposite as their all in one workspace to help them plan, source for, and manage all their upcoming events and trips, so they are looking for this quote to come through the system- just to keep communication all in one place. 

Just claim your account <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> and after inputting your basic information, the request will be in your quotes dashboard. 

We've helped brands like the Hard Rock, Rosa Mexicano, Topgolf, Standard Hotels, Carmine's, STK, Pinstripes, Live Nation and more connect with professional planners who book large meetings, corporate outings, and leisure group itineraries. On the planner side of the platform we work with brands like ConferenceDirect, Global Travel Collection, Meetings Made Easy, Amex Global Business Travel, and more to streamline the group planning process from A to Z. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you run into any issues creating your account!

Hi  {lead_first_name},
 
Thanks so much for getting back to me and following up! I won't be able to provide as much detail as my client, the event planner I'm working with, so I'd actually love to connect you directly with them since they'll be your best point of contact for this group and can help answer these questions.

It's the best and easiest way to connect and discuss these details since the event planners we work with pretty much use our software everyday, but let me know if you have any other questions!

Hi {agent_name},

Unfortunately, we don't use outside companies to send quotes to a client. We have our own system set up in house. If your client could reach out directly to us that would be great!

Hi {lead_first_name},

Okay, I’m sorry to hear that as unfortunately, that’s the only way to work with this group.

If you change your mind and want to sign up (for free) to respond to this request, you can register <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a>. After the first lead, you have the opportunity to choose between our Basic Plan and Membership Plan which are both detailed on our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a>!

If you would like to set up a call to discuss this further, one of my colleagues is available, you can schedule a call on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

Hi {agent_name} - great to connect with you. 

I’m a bit confused as I’m not sure what you mean by the “event planner” is that a person or the program Reposite you are talking about. 

Did you reach out to book an event or are you interested in having a sales meeting about this program? 
If it’s about the program, I think we’d like to learn a bit more before signing up although we appreciate the free admission and all the information you shared!","Example 46: {agent_name} sends quote details and urges prospect to sign up and confirms quote details.

Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks so much for getting back to me.

Happy to provide additional context about us as well - Reposite is a B2B marketplace designed to connect suppliers with our expansive network of professional travel and event planners. For suppliers like you,, Reposite is a business development tool designed to help you create relationships with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events in your area; ultimately leading to long-term partnerships and repeat business for you.

Reposite actually offers the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them! If it books, there is a commission owed to Reposite.  You can claim your account <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> and after inputting your basic information, the request will be in your quotes dashboard.

Hello  {agent_name},

I did receive another email from ‘Reposite’ earlier today and I am not interested. I would rather not sign up for a program, I am already using a platform for private dining that is working just fine for us. If your client would like to gather more information on our program and check availability, they are more than welcome to reach me via email, my cell number below, or they can go to MatthewsRestaurant.com and fill out the inquiry form on the private dining section of the website. That form will also come directly to me 😊 Thank you for your call.

Hi {lead_first_name},

No problem at all, we thought that you might be interested in working with one of our planner partners so we wanted to reach out and give you that opportunity. However, I am unable to pass along your contact information as they organize all of their itineraries through the platform..

To provide a little more context - Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought-after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to hundreds of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. In this instance one of our planners is actively planning a trip, thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote.

There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. On our basic free plan, there is a commission owed to Reposite for successful bookings but through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived.

If you change your mind you can view all of the quote details and respond by registering using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> or check out our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a>! 

Sounds like this isn't a good fit but just figured it was worth giving you all the information, best of luck!
