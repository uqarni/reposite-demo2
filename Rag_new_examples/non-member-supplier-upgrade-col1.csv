"Hi {agent_name},
 Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
 My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.

 In order to quote please provide the following information:
 What date would be your activity?
 Time of the activity.
 Duration of the activity.
 Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
 I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.

 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
 Can you help me with next steps? 
 Cheers,

"Hi {agent_name}, 
 

 Thanks, yes I am the correct contact for group reservations. 
 I was concerned about your quote email from 9/20/23 .... worried it was spam and did not want to click on links. 
 

 I tried calling the phone # of Anand  646 688-0433 and have left messages. 
 

 Please text me at 435 649-1674 and will call you right back.  
 

 I hope it works to play music for you!

"Hi {agent_name}, 

Yes, I can help you with group events! Which date are you looking for, and for how many people? What type of event are you looking for? 

Please keep in mind we are not a regular restaurant that accepts dinner reservations; you must book a private event to have the club open past 7:30pm Tuesday-Friday, or any day outside of that.
