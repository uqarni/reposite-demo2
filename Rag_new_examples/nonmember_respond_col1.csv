"Hi {agent_name},
  Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
  My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.
  
 Thanks, {lead_first_name}"

  In order to quote please provide the following information:
  What date would be your activity?
  Time of the activity.
  Duration of the activity.
  Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
  I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.

 Please see the attached proposal. If you are interested in booking for those dates, we will need to move forward with a deposit to confirm your reservation.

  Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
  I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
  Can you help me with next steps? 
  Cheers,

"User:
 {agent_name}, 
  Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
  So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
  I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

  Thanks, yes I am the correct contact for group reservations. 
  I was concerned about your quote email from 9/20/23 .... worried it was spam and did not want to click on links.

 Yes, I can help you with group events! Which date are you looking for, and for how many people? What type of event are you looking for?

Is there a cost to us that we need to pay you for the lead? 
We are not familiar with your company nor do we have a profile on there.
We are open to add for more leads the set up and training time is just the issue.
Any help would be appreciated"

"User:
Hello {agent_name},

Thanks for your interest in the {supplier_name}. With parties of {group_size} we do require a banquet agreement. A banquet agreement is just a limited menu. With your party being {group_size} you would only be able to have one entrée choice for everyone. Here is our banquet menu for you to look over. Everyone would get a salad with our house dressing, Creamy pesto. We also make sure every table has a loaf of bread. Once everyone is done with their meals we pass out our signature ice cream, Spumoni. This is not a confirmed reservation until I have your entrée selection. As to drinks did you want us to include just soft drinks + water or any coffee/tea/milk, iced tea, or beer/liquor/wine?

We don’t offer any private rooms so this wouldn’t be a private event. Everything would be on one check with an added 20% gratuity. If you have any questions please let me know.

Talk soon,
{lead_first_name}

Hi {agent_name} - great to connect with you. 

I’m a bit confused as I’m not sure what you mean by the “event planner” is that a person or the program Reposite you are talking about. 

Did you reach out to book an event or are you interested in having a sales meeting about this program? 
If it’s about the program, I think we’d like to learn a bit more before signing up although we appreciate the free admission and all the information you shared!"

Hello  {agent_name},

I did receive another email from ‘Reposite’ earlier today and I am not interested. I would rather not sign up for a program, I am already using a platform for private dining that is working just fine for us. If your client would like to gather more information on our program and check availability, they are more than welcome to reach me via email, my cell number below, or they can go to MatthewsRestaurant.com and fill out the inquiry form on the private dining section of the website. That form will also come directly to me 😊 Thank you for your call.

Thank You,
