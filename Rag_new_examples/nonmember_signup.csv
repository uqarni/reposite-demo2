 Hi {lead_first_name},
  
 Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the planners we work with, {reseller_org_name}, is sourcing suppliers in {destination} for their group of {group_size} people. We didn't have enough {category} options for {reseller_org_name} within our network so we did a little research, noticed {supplier_name} looked like a great fit, and sent you the group lead directly. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it, you can view it and respond directly to planner using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 
 
That link will take you through a very abbreviated sign up flow and then right to quotes dashboard to reply. There’s no cost associated with signing up and replying to this lead. Once you're set up, I'd recommend visiting our membership page <a href={membership_link}> here </a> to learn more about the different plans we offer and how we can help drive consistent group business.
 
You can also check out this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform to see everything in action or book a meeting on my <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> to discuss with the team! 
 
Is there any additional information I can provide to help you get started?

 Hey {lead_first_name},

 Great to meet you! I'd love to get you in touch directly with the planner to disucss the details of this request.  
 
 For a little context on Reposite, we connect companies like {supplier_name} with professional planners who are regularly booking meetings, events, and conferences. This planner, {reseller_org_name}, recently posted a need in {destination} for {group_size} people and {supplier_name} looked like a fit so we sent the lead directly to you.

Thanks for getting back to me, happy to provide some additional context for you:

One of the planners using Reposite, {reseller_org_name}, is looking for a {category} for their group. After doing some research, we thought you looked like a great fit so we figured we’d give you the opportunity to respond with a quote.  You are not currently on our platform yet but you can claim your account <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> and after inputting your basic information, the request will be in your quotes dashboard. 

Reposite actually offers the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them! If it books, there is a commission owed to Reposite.

We've helped brands like the Hard Rock, Rosa Mexicano, Topgolf, Standard Hotels, Carmine's, STK, Pinstripes, Live Nation and more connect with professional planners who book large meetings, corporate outings, and leisure group itineraries. On the planner side of the platform we work with brands like ConferenceDirect, Global Travel Collection, Meetings Made Easy, Amex Global Business Travel, and more to streamline the group planning process from A to Z. 

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any issues creating your account.

Cheers,

 {agent_name}, 
  So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
  I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

If you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership, for just {price} for the year, no additional fees or commissions. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

 Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months?

 User:
 Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
  My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

 Thanks for your quick response and taking the time to meet with the team! I'm excited to hear you're getting acquainted with Reposite.

 Hi {agent_name},
  I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way. We primarily market with OpenTable for standard dining and directly to other local DMCs and concierges right now, but we are not using any formal platforms to do so.

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name},

Great to hear you are considering upgrading to the membership.

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

If you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership, for just {price} for the year, no additional fees or commissions. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

I also want to make one important distinction between Reposite and booking platforms like OpenTable - at Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
 If you would like to jump on a quick call to walk through the difference between the free and paid plans, you can book a time that works for you on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a>.

If you decide to move forward, you can navigate to this <a href={buy_link}> link </a> to purchase the annual subscription.

Thanks for getting back to me and I’m happy to provide a little more context:

One of the planners using Reposite is looking for a {category} for their group and after doing some research we thought you looked like a great fit so we figured we’d give you the opportunity to respond with a quote. 

Meeting & event planners leverage Reposite as their all-in-one workspace to discover new suppliers, organize their trips & quotes, & build their itineraries. When they're planning trips, they’re able to research {category} suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests.

 Certainly, I'd be happy to explain how Reposite works!
 

 Reposite is a platform where suppliers like {supplier_name} can showcase their services to travel and event planners. 
 

 {reseller_org_name}, a travel planner we work with, initiated a group reservation request for a trip in {destination}. You can see the details and respond to this request directly through Reposite via the following <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>.
 

 There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite. We do charge a commission on successful bookings but through our <a href={membership_link}> Membership Program </a>, you receive all matching inbound leads with all commissions waived. You also gain full access to our network of planners, networking events, and virtual meet and greets. 
 
If you are interested in discussing membership benefits with a team member, you can schedule an appointment on my colleague’s <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a>. Alternatively, you can watch this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform.

Hi Team,
 
 Great to meet you and thanks for reaching out! To give you a little introduction, Reposite is a marketplace that connects suppliers like {supplier_name} with professional planners who book meetings, events, and conferences. For the planners, Reposite makes it extremely easy to source for all of their needs related to an event or travel itinerary. For you, Reposite acts as a powerful tool to expand your network of professional planners and receive inbound group leads. We were also recently acquired by Cvent, the world's leading event technology platform, which will allow us to expand our database to 100,000+ planners.  

 The reason I'm contacting you is to provide some assistance on your first group reservation request from {reseller_org_name} which you can view and respond to by navigating to this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>. You can also learn more about Reposite by checking out our <a href={membership_link}> membership page </a> and this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform.

Reposite actually offers the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them! If it books, there is a commission owed to Reposite.

We've helped brands like the Hard Rock, Rosa Mexicano, Topgolf, Standard Hotels, Carmine's, STK, Pinstripes, Live Nation and more connect with professional planners who book large meetings, corporate outings, and leisure group itineraries. On the planner side of the platform we work with brands like ConferenceDirect, Global Travel Collection, Meetings Made Easy, Amex Global Business Travel, and more to streamline the group planning process from A to Z. 

 If you are looking to connect with more professional planners and receiving these types of leads, I would recommend considering an upgrade to our full membership.

Hey {lead_first_name} - 

That’s correct, you don’t currently have an account set up to respond to this RFP and that’s why we are reaching out to you for this this opportunity.

Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
  
Reposite helps meeting and event planners, travel agents, tour operators and more discover new suppliers, organize all their itineraries, and put together proposals for their clients. They’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
  
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our full Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. You can explore all of our membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a>.
  
 Do you think it’s worth trying out this time to evaluate as a potential sales and marketing tool for {supplier_name}?
 
 Best,

 Dear {agent_name},
  
  I hope this email finds you well.
  
  Unfortunately, I am not authorized to access to this portal and get a membership, therefore, I won’t be able to provide a proposal for you.
  
  I will remain attentive to any other request, and I will be glad to assist you directly via email.

Hi {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for getting back to me! 

Were you able to submit the quote? For any technical issues with the platform, please reach out to premiumsupport@reposite.io.

The first lead with Reposite is always free. After that, we recommend upgrading to our <a href={membership_link}> membership </a> plan to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

 If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers. You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a commission.

 What other tools do you use to generate consistent group business?

Hey {lead_first_name} - completely understand. As I mentioned,, the first lead is complimentary and a commission is only owed if a booking is received so I definitely recommend trying out to see if it’s a good fit for you.
 
 Do you have other methods in place to drive group business to {supplier_name}?

 User:
 Hello, 
  We basically work with other companies like below:
  1- You can email us the trip details and we can let you know our availability. 
  2- Then if you would like to proceed, we will input the reservations and sent you confirmation emails and a CC form. 
  3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking after receiving the CC.
  4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
  Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.
  Have a good day.

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.
 
 However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a <a href={membership_link}> membership </a>. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

Assistant: 
Definitely understand your preference to wait for a booking to happen before signing up but I would like to provide some additional insight regarding this approach:
 
 RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners are sent to our members a full 24-48 hours before they are made available to any users on our Basic plan. The data we have shows that responses submitted within those first two days have a much higher likelihood of being booked, and for that reason, are almost always awarded to paying members.

Our Basic plan is meant to showcase the functionality of the platform and expose you to the types of planners and leads on the marketplace. If you think this is a good fit, I would highly recommend upgrading your membership so that you can start receiving more leads like this, networking with planners and actively work on increasing group bookings to your business.
 
If you would like to set up a call to discuss this further, one of my colleagues is available, you can schedule a call on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you .

 I'll definitely take a closer look at the membership benefits you've provided in the link. It's essential for us to maximize our visibility and connections within your network, so this option seems promising.
 We're very interested in upgrading to a full membership but we'd like to work with our first group first to ensure everything aligns as expected. Once we've had a successful experience with our initial engagement, we'll proceed with the membership to leverage the full benefits of your network.
 
 Currently, we rely on a mix of tools and resources for sourcing group business, including industry-specific forums, social media platforms, and some partnerships with local event planning associations. However, we're always open to exploring new avenues that can help us expand our reach and enhance our business development efforts.
 I'll review the membership details and discuss it further with my team to make an informed decision. Thanks again for your guidance and support.
 
 Best regards, 
 {lead_first_name}
 

 Assistant:
Definitely understand your preference to wait for a booking to happen before signing up but I would like to provide some additional insight regarding this approach:
 
 RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners are sent to our members a full 24-48 hours before they are made available to any users on our Basic plan. The data we have shows that responses submitted within those first two days have a much higher likelihood of being booked, and for that reason, are almost always awarded to paying members.

Our Basic plan is meant to showcase the functionality of the platform and expose you to the types of planners and leads on the marketplace. If you think this is a good fit, I would highly recommend upgrading your membership so that you can start receiving more leads like this, networking with planners and actively work on increasing group bookings to your business.
 
If you would like to set up a call to discuss this further, one of my colleagues is available, you can schedule a call on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you . If you decide to move forward with membership, you can purchase the annual subscription <a href={buy_link}> here </a>.

 Hey {lead_first_name},

Great to hear from you.

We offer all 10 Reposite categories everywhere, within those categories there are a bunch of subtypes as well so that our database of suppliers can cover anything that our planner partners might be looking for. {destination} is no different and Reposite membership is based on market/city not neighborhood within a city so you can list your services for {category} throughout {destination}.

Regarding the number of {category} requests in {destination}, I don’t currently have access to that information as Reposite is an always evolving and growing marketplace. With the addition of Cvent’s database of 125,000 planner partners, we are also expecting a ton of growth in RFP volume so historical data won’t be that relevant moving forward.

You can check out our member benefits page <a href={membership_link}> here </a> along with this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform to evaluatee if this is a good tool for {supplier_name}. If you would like to set up a call to discuss this further, one of my colleagues is available, you can schedule a call on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you .

Great to hear from you. Yes, that’s correct. If you receive a booking from {reseller_org_name} made through Reposite on the free plan, two separate commissions would apply: your agreed commission to {reseller_org_name} and Reposite's commission. Remember Reposite commission only applies for basic members.
 
However, if you were a full Reposite member, Reposite does not take commissions on bookings earned during your annual subscription.  

Full membership also comes with many other advantages such as direct access to our database of over 100,000 planners, invites to networking events, and priority response time for inbound requests.
