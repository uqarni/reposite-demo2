"Hi {agent_name}, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?","Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the travel planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. (For our basic plan, we charge a small 15% commission on all successful bookings.) 

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships (average group size on Reposite last month was 72), I'd highly recommend considering our full membership program. It gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

There is no cost to sign up and respond to this lead. After the first lead, you have the option to upgrade to our membership plan or remain on the basic plan. 

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

"Hello {agent_name},
 At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.

 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}","Hi {lead_first_name},
 
I recommend a full Reposite membership to fully utilize our platform. Statistically we've seen that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Suppliers that are on our full membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses. That, plus all commissions are waived for members as well. Full membership perks details are <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .
 
 As for your question about training courses, members do have regular virtual ""meet-and-greets"" with travel and event planners - it's an excellent opportunity to engage with the community and to learn from one another.

Hi {lead_first_name},

Will do, and it's great to be connected! Wanted to make sure that you saw the quote request from {reseller_org_name} -they're looking for a restaurant for a group of {group_size} in {destination}. It was originally sent to {email}, but you can view it and all the details directly in the platform by registering via this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>. 

Reposite offers the first lead for free so that our clients can sign up, experience the platform, and potentially land a booking at no risk to them! After the first lead, you have the opportunity to choose between our Basic Plan and Membership Plan, you can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a> and check out this short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform.

Do you have other platforms that you use to help attract new group business / planners?

 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
 Can you help me with next steps?

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. You can view all the quote details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by following the <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

There is no cost to <a href={nmqrurl}> sign up </a> and respond to this lead. After the first lead, you have the option to upgrade to our membership plan or remain on the basic plan. 

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

{agent_name}, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Great question, you may have heard from both our marketplace health and supplier partnerships team.

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount.

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best, 
{agent_name}

User:
Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks for the update and I understand that this might be a new way of doing business for you.

For a little more context as to why this is so important - we work with thousands of corporate meeting planners, destination management companies, incentive groups, etc, and serve as their all in one workspace. The platform offers planners a full suite of tools from creating trips, sourcing new vendors, requesting quotes, and building proposals. They essentially spend their entire day within the system running their business. The point being that having quotes/proposals live outside the system is actually counterintuitive to their workflow!

In addition to that the great part is that once you are all set up you can actually reply to the new leads directly from your inbox since we integrate with your email, so you don't have to login each time a new request is sent your way. 

The first lead with Reposite is always free. After that, we recommend upgrading to our membership plan to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the <a href={membership_link}> membership </a> offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers. You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a 15% commission.

Would you like to set up a meeting to discuss further?

Hi {lead_first_name}, 

There is no cost to <a href={nmqrurl}> sign up </a> and respond to this lead. After the first lead, you have the option to upgrade to our membership plan or remain on the basic plan. 

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a> and a short <a href={demo_link}> demo </a> of the platform as well.

Hey {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our full Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived.

Hi {lead_first_name},

Totally understand your hesitation to sign up for something you aren’t familiar with but Reposite is a powerful tool for professional travel and event planners, who could send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 

For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of group that you're looking to work with, then the membership is a no brainer. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 3,000+ planners within the Reposite network. 

Our team hosts bi-weekly webinars for new and prospective members, if you would like to join, just register <a href={webinar_link}> here </a> and let me know so I can make sure I give them a heads up you will be joining.

Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?

The first lead with Reposite is always free. After that, we recommend upgrading to our <a href={membership_link}> membership </a> plan to continue receiving group requests like this one. More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers. You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a 15% commission.

Thanks for the breakdown. Seems like you have a system in place, but I do have to say that this is likely preventing you from receiving consistent group business from B2B professional travel and event planners. That model generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).

Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.

If you have any interest in growing your business through these types of planners, I invite you to join one of our profile optimization <a href={webinar_link}> webinars </a> for new members. 
If you have any questions after that or would prefer a one-on-one, you can schedule a tiem on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

More importantly, the membership plan offers unlimited access to our Discover tool to allow you to find and connect with professional planners who consistently plan meetings, events, and leisure travel itineraries in your city.

If you choose not to upgrade to our membership plan, you are able to maintain a free profile but you will not have access to the business development tools that the platform offers. You may receive a lead from time to time, but only when Reposite’s current network of suppliers in your area cannot fulfill the request. If a lead were to book, you’d owe Reposite a 15% commission..

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a <a href={membership_link}> membership </a>. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city.

RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners hit the marketplace for our full members 24 hours before they are made available to any users on our basic plan. (Statistically, half of the bookings go for suppliers who respond in the first 24 hours.) Our basic plan is meant to showcase the functionality of the platform and show you to the types of planners and leads on the marketplace.

Hey {lead_first_name} -

I saw you just set up an account for {supplier_name} on Reposite! Congrats on being invited by {reseller_org_name}.

So we can help tailor future leads for you: what's your ideal type of group business (corporate, student groups, international groups, luxury, etc.)?

User:
Hi {agent_name},
Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your warm words regarding our presence on Reposite and the opportunity with {reseller_org_name}.

To provide some insight into our ideal type of group business, we have a strong track record of successfully working with a diverse range of clients, including students, wedding groups, and international groups. We pride ourselves on delivering exceptional experiences tailored to each client's unique needs.

I'd also like to highlight that we have our own fleet of buses, which allows us to ensure top-notch transportation services for our clients. Furthermore, we hold permits for exclusive experiences, such as the bioluminescent bay night kayaking tour, access to El Yunque National Forest, and meet-and-greet services inside the airport terminal. It's important to note that we don't subcontract our services because we are the direct providers, which enables us to maintain strict quality control and a seamless customer experience.

We look forward to exploring potential opportunities on Reposite.

Best regards,

Hi {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for sharing such detailed insights into your operations at {supplier_name}. I'm thrilled to hear of your experience in handling a diverse range of groups and the unique offerings for your clients. I believe this will be immensely valuable to our planners network. 

If you have not already, you can sign up to respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by registering for free via this <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a>.

Basic plan users can maintain a free profile on the platform that is shareable with their existing network of planners. In other words, if you already have great connections with corporate meeting planners, travel agents, tour operators, etc and you want a tool for managing those relationships more efficiently, you can use Reposite to give your partners updates on pricing, menus, new offerings, etc. from one centralized workspace. Bookings that happen on the basic plan incur a 15% commission.

However, if you are looking to expand your network and drive more custom groups and private events, you'd want to upgrade to a membership. This will give you access to all relevant leads in your market, in addition to our prospecting tool, Discover, which allows you to filter through Reposite's network of professional planners who send business to your city. You can find all the details about our membership plan <a href={membership_link}> here </a>.

Are there other tools or resources you currently use to source group business?

Hi {agent_name},
Thank you for your prompt response and for your kind words about {supplier_name}. I'm glad to hear that our offerings align well with your planners network.

I appreciate your recommendation to consider upgrading to a full membership. I'll definitely take a closer look at the membership benefits you've provided in the link. It's essential for us to maximize our visibility and connections within your network, so this option seems promising.
We're very interested in upgrading to a full membership, but we'd like to work with our first group first to ensure everything aligns as expected. Once we've had a successful experience with our initial engagement, we'll proceed with the membership to leverage the full benefits of your network.

Currently, we rely on a mix of tools and resources for sourcing group business, including industry-specific forums, social media platforms, and some partnerships with local event planning associations. However, we're always open to exploring new avenues that can help us expand our reach and enhance our business development efforts.
I'll review the membership details and discuss it further with my team to make an informed decision. Thanks again for your guidance and support.

Best regards, 
{lead_first_name}

Assistant:
That makes complete sense, and given your goal to maximize your visibility and connections, I want to be as transparent with you as possible.

RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners are sent to our members a full 24 hours before they are made available to any users on our Basic plan. The data we have shows that responses submitted within those critical first 24 hours have a much higher likelihood of being booked, and for that reason, are almost always awarded to paying members. Our Basic plan is meant to showcase the functionality of the platform and expose you to the types of planners and leads on the marketplace. If you think this is a good fit, I would highly recommend upgrading your membership so that you can start receiving more leads like this, networking with planners and actively work on increasing group bookings to your business.

If you would like to learn more, our team hosts bi-weekly <a href={webinar_link}> webinars </a> for new and prospective members, if you’d prefer a one-one-one, you can book a time on the <a href={calendar_link}> calendar </a> that works best for you.

{lead_first_name}","Hey {lead_first_name},

Regarding the number of requests in your area, the exact number is dynamic because the Reposite marketplace continues to evolve daily. As for the region that your service covers, the membership rate remains the same even if your services extend beyond {destination}. Therefore, you can connect with a broad network of planners without any additional cost!

Our platform is designed to connect you with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events in your area, leading to long term partnerships and repeat business. In fact, the success of suppliers we work with often exceeds their initial membership investment due to rich connections with travel & event planners. Since the membership costs {price} per year and the average group size on Reposite last month was 72, even a single booking could potentially cover the cost!

Access to comprehensive industry-leading training to learn how to position your offerings and get in front of professional travel & event planners (4 x 1-hour sessions, $2k value)
Invites to VIP networking events, planner meet n' greets, and other networking opportunities
Added to the searchable database of over 2,100 professional planners within the Reposite network

Great to hear from you. You've got it right. If you receive a booking from Elite Visionary Consulting made through Reposite , two separate commissions would apply. That would be your agreed commission to Elite and Reposite's 15% commission. Remember Reposite commission only applies for basic members.

However, if you were a full Reposite member, the membership waives all commissions on bookings earned during your membership period. Simply put, being a member means you only have to worry about the commissions you've directly negotiated with the travel planners.

However, if you were a full Reposite member, the membership waives all commissions on bookings earned during your membership period. Simply put, being a member means you only have to worry about the commissions you've directly negotiated with the travel planners.

Full membership also comes with many other advantages such as direct access to our pool of planners, invites to networking events, and speedier response times for quotes. You can find more about our membership perks here .

Please feel free to reach out if you need more information.

Best,
