Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the travel planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite. (For non-members, we charge a small 15% commission on all successful bookings.) 

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

User:
{agent_name}, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Even though this specific group may not make sense, I still highly recommend responding just to build the relationship - {reseller_org_name} plan a lot of events/trips in the area, and have told me that they're looking for long-term partners.

Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a>.

Hi {lead_first_name},

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).

The first lead from Reposite is 100% complimentary, if you receive a booking, there’s just a 15% commission owed to Reposite. Definitely think it’s worth signing up to respond as it could be a great longterm partnership made by connecting with{reseller_org_name}.

Hello, 
 We basically work with other companies like below:
 1- You can email us the trip details and we can let you know our availability. 
 2- Then if you would like to proceed, we will input the reservations and sent you confirmation emails and a CC form. 
 3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking after receiving the CC.
 4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
 Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.

Hi team - thanks for the info. Reposite is a B2B marketplace that connects all types of vendors with professional planners who handle all types of group travel and event itineraries. Our marketplace very often receives group requests that don't require a private experience. Are you able to take group reservations?

Cheers,

Hi {lead_first_name}, 

I'm sincerely glad to hear that you're finding a balance amidst your swiftly growing business and personal commitments. Thumbs up to you for juggling it all! 

I'm always here to assist you with questions, but wanted to provide a little more context for when you have a few minutes later today! One of the travel planners we work with was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. Travel & event planners leverage Reposite as their all-in-one workspace to discover new suppliers, organize their trips & quotes, & build their itineraries. When they're planning trips, they’re able to research {category} suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests.
 
You can get in touch directly with the planner by following the instructions below:

You can view the details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> .
Under Organization Name make sure to enter it as "" {supplier_name} "" this will ensure you are brought directly to the quote request
You can also sign up from the original lead email, <a href={nmqr_signup_video}> this video </a> walks you through that process

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Any chance that you have five to ten minutes to speak with me over the phone? 
I'm very much an old school oriented gentleman and I abhor getting bogged down 
with so much technology! Text, chat, email are all the same in that it's far too easy 
to misconstrue the intended message! Rather, I prefer to be able to hear the inflection in a person's voice! 

Respectfully

Assistant:
Totally understand - while we always offer the bi-weekly Q+A sessions as the first option to help streamline things, we can certainly make an exception and set up a call to walk you through everything. You can choose a time off of Nathalie's calendar <a href={calendar_link}> here </a> (updated in real time) to help with the back-and-forth of scheduling!

Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks for your swift response! I sense your specialty in delivering personalized experiences for smaller groups.

Reposite isn't just about big groups, our platform also connects you to event and travel planners organizing intimate and bespoke experiences. This particular group is a group of {group_size}, which would very well match your capacity of hosting 4 to 5 passengers at a time.

You can view the details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> .
