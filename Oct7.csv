Hi Taylor, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?

assistant: 

Hi {lead_first_name},

Great to connect with you! High level, {reseller_org_name} is looking for a staffing provider for a group of {group_size} in {destination} for {trip_dates} next year. Since you're already on our basic free plan, you should be able to view the full request and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by logging into your Reposite account. Let me know if you run into any trouble accessing.

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships (average group size on Reposite last month was 72), I'd highly recommend considering our full membership program. It gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

Hello Taylor,
At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships, our membership program gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons.

As for your question about training courses, members do have regular virtual ""meet-and-greets"" with travel and event planners - it's an excellent opportunity to engage with the community and to learn from one another.

Hi {lead_first_name},

Great to be connected! I understand it may be a little confusing initially. Reposite is a platform designed to connect travel and event planners with {category}s like {supplier_name}. It equips {category}s with tools and resources to win both inbound and outbound group business development efforts.

Currently, you are on our basic free plan, where you can receive direct inbound requests, but with limited transparency or ability to promote your property fully. A Reposite membership significantly expands your access and control, helping you connect with a wider network of planners who organize a variety of events (You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}).

Great to be connected! I understand it may be a little confusing initially. Reposite is a platform designed to connect travel and event planners with {category}s like {supplier_name}. It equips {category}s with tools and resources to win both inbound and outbound group business development efforts.

Currently, you are on our basic free plan, where you can receive direct inbound requests, but with limited transparency or ability to promote your property fully.

Hi {lead_first_name}, 
Thanks for sharing the information with your management team.

Currently, you're benefiting from our basic plan, where you can receive some direct inbound requests. However, to enjoy a wealth of benefits in promoting Universal Sky Services, I recommend upgrading to our Full Membership. 

With a Full Membership, you gain tools to attract and respond to more group business, matched inbound leads and can enjoy building relationships through our platform. All commissions and fees are waived for the duration of your membership. 
For more detailed information about the transformative benefits of becoming a Reposite member, please visit: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1 

Does Universal Sky Services already utilize a platform or sourcing tool to help drive group business your way? 

Best, 
Taylor",,

Separately, our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the Denver area in the past few months. So if you're wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business, then I highly suggest checking out our membership program. You qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed here (which gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year, and gives you unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new restaurants / venues).
Do you have other platforms that you use to help attract new group business / planners?

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. 
You can view all the quote details and respond directly to Savor Our City by following the link: https://app.reposite.io/suppliers?startTab=signUp&quoteLifecycleUUID=98db6437-2288-44d1-9a41-44dc906aa899&auth=signUp 
There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. 
However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. 
Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

Taylor, 
Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Hey Dan, 

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 

At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 

And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. 

You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration 
That said, can I help point you towards any other resources or information to better understand how Reposite can benefit your business?

Taylor

Hi Dan, 
Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! 
Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 
In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 
The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. 
Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 
Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 
Best, 
Taylor

Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey Dan, 
Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. 
Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 
{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 
Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite.

My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up!

"Taylor, 
Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

","Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 

At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners.

I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
Can you help me with next steps?

Hey Dan, 
Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. 
You can view all the quote details and respond directly to Savor Our City by following the link: https://app.reposite.io/suppliers?startTab=signUp&quoteLifecycleUUID=98db6437-2288-44d1-9a41-44dc906aa899&auth=signUp 
There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. 
However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. 
Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

Hi Dan, 
Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! 
Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 
In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 
The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. 
Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 
Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months?

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. 
However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. 
Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Hey Dan, 

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 

At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 

And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. 

You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform.

Hi Dan, 
Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! 
Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 
In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 
The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. 
Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 
Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months?

Taylor

Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey Team -
I noticed that you recently received your very first quote request from a planner (360 Destination Group) on Reposite - congrats!
Are you the right person at Courchevel Bistro that handles group reservations?
 
Cheers,

Hello Alexa, 
Thanks for your quick response and taking the time to meet Brenden and Anand! I'm thrilled you're getting acquainted with Reposite. 

While you're transitioning to our platform and securing more group reservations, I'd highly encourage considering our full membership program. It provides unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions and offers unlimited access to outbound prospecting tools to connect with over 2,100+ planners in our network. You can take a closer look at the full list of membership benefits here: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1 

Are you currently using any other sources or tools to generate consistent group business? 
Best, 
Taylor

Hi Taylor,
I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way. We primarily market with OpenTable for standard dining and directly to other local DMCs and concierges right now, but we are not using any formal platforms to do so.

Hey Alexa - that's great news! As you know, you're currently on the basic plan, which is how you were able to see and respond to this lead. I'm certainly crossing my fingers for you, but in full transparency non-members only get notified of the quote 24 hours after it's been posted. Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan - though anything is possible of course! 
OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings. It's a no brainer if it's a priority for Talisker to build a pipeline of group business. 
You can set up your membership through this checkout option, or if you still have questions, my colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week - Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

He has all the information you'll need for available sections, group sizes, F&B minimums, menu options, etc.

Looking forward to working with you, though!

Thanks Erika, and apologies for any confusion. Happy to provide a little more context -

Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to hundreds of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. In this instance one of our planners is actively planning a trip, thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote. There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. 

On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our Membership program ($500 annually), you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. It's worth noting that our average group size is 72, and we've seen a pickup in activity in the Asheville area recently. It's a no brainer if you're looking to grow your pipeline of repeatable group business. 

Do you have other tools/platforms that you use to drive group business to Center for Craft?

 Thanks for your prompt response. To access your free basic account, you simply need to log in through the Reposite website using the credentials you created when you registered. If you're encountering any problems logging in, do let me know and I'll assist as best I can.

 Since discussions about annual fees would be suited for Ada Mabel Rivera, the Director of Sales, could you possibly share her contact information? That way, I can directly reach out to her to discuss the benefits of our membership, which indeed carries an annual fee, and the value it can provide for {supplier_name}'s group reservations.

Hi Luz,

 Certainly, I'm happy to correspond over email instead.

 The message you received was to inform you that your property, {supplier_name}, was identified by a travel planner using Reposite to plan their group travel. These details were forwarded to your current free basic account on Repsoite.

 To view such quotes, and to unlock full benefits such as connecting with more professional planners and receiving unlimited leads, I would recommend considering an upgrade to our full membership. All the features and benefits for becoming members can be perused here: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1

 Before we proceed, are you the right person to discuss group reservations for {supplier_name}?

 Best,
 Taylor

Hi Taylor, Thanks for your email. How can I enter the free basic account?
 
Yes, I work with group reservations; if the membership has annual fees, the right person is our Director of Sales, Ada Mabel Rivera.

Hi Luz,

 Thanks for your prompt response. To access your free basic account, you simply need to log in through the Reposite website using the credentials you created when you registered. If you're encountering any problems logging in, do let me know and I'll assist as best I can.

 Since discussions about annual fees would be suited for Ada Mabel Rivera, the Director of Sales, could you possibly share her contact information? That way, I can directly reach out to her to discuss the benefits of our membership, which indeed carries an annual fee, and the value it can provide for {supplier_name}'s group reservations.

 Best,
 Taylor

Thanks Luz! I will contact Ava directly on their email. The details of the quote request is below for your reference.

The quote request came from Bho Trips -they're looking for a Restaurant for a group of 13 in Puerto Rico in December. It was originally sent to reservations@palacioprovincial.com, but you can view it and all the details directly in the platform by registering via this link. Since this is your first lead, it's complimentary to log in, view and respond directly to Bho Trips. 

Let me know if you have trouble seeing the details from the link above.

They're researching hotel options, and used Reposite to reach out for a quote. The request was originally sent to {lead_first_name}.hoffmaster@hilton.com, but you can also view it and respond directly to the planner via this link.

 This is your first lead from Reposite and it's complimentary! If you're interested in receiving more leads, you might want to consider our full membership program, which provides unlimited leads for a full year and tools/resources to develop lasting partnerships with travel and event planners. The full list of membership benefits are here

 Are you looking to expand your groups business?

 Best, 
Taylor

Hey {lead_first_name} -
No problem at all. If you share the aspects of this lead that don't make sense for the hotel, then I can make a note of that going forward so that you only receive relevant leads. Even though this specific group doesn't make sense, I still highly recommend responding just to build the relationship - FORA advisors plan a lot of events/trips in the area, and have told me that they're looking for long-term partners.
Separately, our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the Cleveland area in the past few months. So if you're wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business, then I highly suggest the membership program. This property actually qualifies for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions if it piques your interest. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.
Cheers,

Hi Dawn,

Thank you for letting me know about the update. I'll ensure all future group business leads come to you directly. Also, thanks for pointing out the issue about only seeing an old 2022 lead on our platform - looks like the newest request wasn't connecting with your existing account, so I'll flag this to my team and make sure that it appears in your quotes dashboard. 

Separately, I can see that you're currently on our basic plan - hotels that are on our membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses plus all commissions from successful bookings are waived for members as well (Full membership perks details for your reference here: Reposite Membership benefits). The 24 hour lead time is valuable, since statistically over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Definitely worth considering if you wanted to get serious about growing a pipeline of group business from travel and event planners.

Are you currently leveraging any platforms or tools to drive more consistent group business your way?

Best, 
Taylor

Hi Dawn,

Thank you for letting me know about the update. I'll ensure all future group business leads come to you directly. Also, thanks for pointing out the issue about only seeing an old 2022 lead on our platform - looks like the newest request wasn't connecting with your existing account, so I'll flag this to my team and make sure that it appears in your quotes dashboard. 

Separately, I can see that you're currently on our basic plan - hotels that are on our membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses plus all commissions from successful bookings are waived for members as well (Full membership perks details for your reference here: Reposite Membership benefits). The 24 hour lead time is valuable, since statistically over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Definitely worth considering if you wanted to get serious about growing a pipeline of group business from travel and event planners.

Are you currently leveraging any platforms or tools to drive more consistent group business your way?

Best, 
Taylor

Hey Sunny - thanks for the quick response. 

I'm glad you brought up CVENT, because almost all of our hotel partners also leverage CVENT as part of their groups strategy. CVENT primarily focuses on large conventions and summits, whereas Reposite is built to help you create relationships with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events. We strive to foster long term partnerships and repeat business for you. Reposite is much more cost-effective as well - you actually qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed here (which gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year, and gives you unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new venues).

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Cheers, 
Taylor

Hi {lead_first_name}, 
It is absolutely free to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to the quote request you received within Reposite. 
The requirement to log in is simply so that you can view the full details of the quote request and submit your proposal. I completely understand budget constraints and want to be clear that there are no hidden fees associated with this activity! 
Now, if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships, we do offer a full membership program that allows unlimited access to leads for a full year, among many other benefits. But that's fully optional and something you can consider whenever your budget allows.

On the first go, you can view the full details and respond directly to TIAA using this link [here]( https://app.reposite.io/suppliers?startTab=signUp&quoteLifecycleUUID=b9fb5f94-7a63-4047-bec4-d4cf4d60a07a&auth=signUp). 

The initial inquiry is complimentary, but if a steady stream of group inquiries and planner partnerships stirs some excitement, you might want to consider our membership program. The program provides unlimited leads, waives commission on all bookings for a year, and much more! You can explore all of our membership benefits [here]( https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1). 

Are there any particular tools or platforms you're currently utilizing to increase your group business? 

Best, 
Taylor

Hi  {lead_first_name},

 Great to connect with you! The request from Debstinations for a group reservation was actually made through Reposite, a platform which links travel and event planners to hotels and other suppliers for their itineraries. They are sourcing for a trip to Punta Cana that will take place 6/16-6/23 2024.

 If you're unable to find the quote request in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to Debstinations here.

 If you're interested in receiving more leads like this, I would highly recommend that you consider our full membership program. It provides unlimited leads for a whole year without hidden fees or add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here.

 Are you looking to grow your groups business or build a more consistent pipeline of groups?

 Best, 
Taylor

Hey  {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.

 Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.

 There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. 
 
Do you have any strategies already in place that help drive group bookings?

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 
My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Hi  {lead_first_name},

 Great to connect with you! The request from Debstinations for a group reservation was actually made through Reposite, a platform which links travel and event planners to hotels and other suppliers for their itineraries. They are sourcing for a trip to Punta Cana that will take place 6/16-6/23 2024.

 If you're unable to find the quote request in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to Debstinations here.

 If you're interested in receiving more leads like this, I would highly recommend that you consider our full membership program. It provides unlimited leads for a whole year without hidden fees or add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here.

 Are you looking to grow your groups business or build a more consistent pipeline of groups?

 Best, 
Taylor

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 
My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 
My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Hi  {lead_first_name}, 
Great to hear from you! While it's delightful to see that you're ready to send out a quote, it's important to get properly connected first. Right now, you're on our basic free plan where you have limited access to handle inbound requests. 
In order to fully utilize the platform and enjoy unlimited access to all inbound leads, you can upgrade to a full Reposite membership which will support your efforts in creating long term relationships with travel and event planners. You can review the membership perks here: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1 
By becoming a full member, you'll be able to maximize your business' potential and enjoy benefits like automatic matching with relevant planners, a 24-hour head start on responses and priority ranking of responses on all RFPs. 
Glad to see your enthusiasm, and I look forward to seeing {supplier_name} take full advantage of your Reposite membership. 
What other lead sources do you guys use to generate consistent group business? 
Cheers, 
Taylor

You qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed here (which gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year, and gives you unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new venues).
Do you have other methods in place to drive group business to MIB?

Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.

Absolutely, I understand your concern. Bho Trips is interested in booking a travel package for a group size of 13 and the trip is scheduled from 12/18-12/23, in Puerto Rico. They found Royal Star through Reposite and wanted to get a quote.

Just to clarify, Reposite is a B2B marketplace that connects suppliers like Royal Star with a network of professional travel and event planners. Your first lead is complimentary, but as an annual member of Reposite, you would get regular notifications about requests like this one from Bho Trips and have the opportunity to respond directly to win the business.

Our membership program offers tools for creating strong relationships with planners, leading to repeat bookings. You can access our expansive database of planners who organize diverse events – everything from corporate meetings to leisure group travel. You can view a full list of membership benefits here

Are you looking to build a more consistent pipeline of groups?

Totally understand your rationale on this. It's worth noting that our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the Puerto Rico area in the past few months. So membership is really only designed for providers who are wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business via B2B planners. Most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 

I will say that you qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed here (which gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year, and gives you unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new transportation providers).

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the sign up links  for Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Hey Elisabeth - To answer your question, one of the travel planners we work with was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite.

Travel & event planners leverage Reposite as their all-in-one workspace to discover new suppliers, organize their trips & quotes, & build their itineraries. When they're planning trips, they’re able to research activity suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests.

Your first lead through Reposite is complimentary, but future leads are withheld unless you're a member. However, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of Reposite Membership benefits at $500 rate (lowest available). It's a no brainer if you're looking to get more group leads and connect with more group planners. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?
