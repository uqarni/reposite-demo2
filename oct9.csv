"Hi Taylor, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?","Hi {lead_first_name},

Great to connect with you! High level, {reseller_org_name} is looking for a staffing provider for a group of {group_size} in {destination} for {trip_dates} next year. Since you're already on our basic free plan, you should be able to view the full request and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by logging into your Reposite account. Let me know if you run into any trouble accessing.

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships (average group size on Reposite last month was 72), I'd highly recommend considering our full membership program. It gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}

No problem at all. If you share the aspects of this lead that don't make sense for the hotel, then I can make a note of that going forward so that you only receive relevant leads.

 Certainly, I'm happy to correspond over email instead.

 The message you received was to inform you that your property, {supplier_name}, was identified by a travel planner using Reposite to plan their group travel. These details were forwarded to your current free basic account on Repsoite.

 To unlock full benefits such as connecting with more professional planners and receiving unlimited leads, I would recommend considering an upgrade to our full membership. All the features and benefits for becoming members can be perused here: {membership_link}

","Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network.

Just to clarify, Reposite is a B2B marketplace that connects suppliers like {supplier_name} with a network of professional travel and event planners.

"Hi Taylor,
Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.

Thanks, {lead_first_name}","Hi {lead_first_name},

Great to hear from you and thanks for providing that update! Tim is on the team that helps suppliers who receive their first quote request to get set up so that they can view the full details from the planner and respond without a hitch. Since you're already on our basic free plan, you should be able to view the full request and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} trips by logging into your Reposite account. Let me know if you run into any trouble accessing.

The first lead is complimentary (you only owe commission if you are awarded the booking!) Since you mentioned that you're interested in receiving more group events and group reservations, I'd highly recommend considering our Membership program - it gives unlimited leads for a full year and waives all commissions / add-ons. Membership perks include outbound prospecting tools, direct matches with over 2,100+ planners in our network, and priority response times on all quotes that you submit (You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}).

"Taylor, 
Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

","Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 

At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 

And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. 

You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform.

","Hi {lead_first_name}, 
Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! 
Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 
In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 
The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. 
Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 
Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months?

"Hi Taylor,
I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way.

{supplier_name} {email}","Hey {lead_first_name} - that's great news! As you know, you're currently on the basic plan, which is how you were able to see and respond to this lead. I'm certainly crossing my fingers for you, but in full transparency non-members only get notified of the quote 24 hours after it's been posted. Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan. 
OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings. It's a no brainer if it's a priority for {supplier_name} to build a pipeline of group business.

Reposite is a marketplace connecting travel & event professionals to sought after suppliers like yourself. Through Reposite you can gain access to hundreds of new travel & event planners who are planning trips in your area. In this instance one of our planners is actively planning a trip, thought you looked like a great fit, and reached out to request a quote. There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. 

On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our Membership program ($500 annually), you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. It's worth noting that our average group size is 72, and we've seen a pickup in activity in the {destination} area recently.

Travel & event planners leverage Reposite as their all-in-one workspace to discover new suppliers, organize their trips & quotes, & build their itineraries. When they're planning trips, they’re able to research activity suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests.
