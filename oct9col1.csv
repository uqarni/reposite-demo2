"Good Morning Taylor, Can this be made within monthly payments? Can you please explain how your platform works?"
"Hello Taylor,
At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.
Would you happen to know if you have any training courses? At the same time, I was wondering how I could get a receipt for the last charge I placed on my credit Card.
Cheers,
{lead_first_name} Plumb"

"Taylor, 
Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
Can you help me with next steps? 
Cheers,

"Hello, 
Yes, I am. However, we have never signed up for Reposite nor are we affiliated with said company. 
I am not aware of any new reservations through Reposite?

We are definitely interested and will look into it.

"I'm not. The person you want to contact for group reservations is Jason Yelton (jason@dbrparkcity.com).

He has all the information you'll need for available sections, group sizes, F&B minimums, menu options, etc.

Looking forward to working with you, though!

All leads should flow to me not Edita. I handle all group business. 
Also, when I log on your platform, I only see an old 2022 lead. Nothing current.

I hope this email finds you well.
 
We do not use this platform to respond to RFP. Could you print the request to PDF and send it to me? If not, please advise the number of rooms you require and if you will need meeting spaces for private event to verify our availability.
 
I remain attentive to your comments.

"Hello, 
We basically work with other companies like below:
1- You can email us the trip details and we can let you know our availability. 
2- Then if you would like to proceed, we will input the reservations and sent you confirmation emails and a CC form. 
3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking  after receiving the CC.
4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and  pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.
Have a good day.

"Good morning Taylor,

In order to quote please provide the following information:
What date would be your activity?
Time of the activity.
Duration of the activity.
Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.

Best,

"Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

"Hi Taylor, 

Thanks, yes I am the correct contact for group reservations. 
I was concerned about your quote email from 9/20/23 .... worried it was spam and did not want to click on links. 

I tried calling the phone # of Anand   646 688-0433 and have left messages. 

Please text me at 435 649-1674 and will call you right back.  

I hope it works to play music for you!

"Hi
I’ll let the team respond with further details.
 
As for the enquiry we received – we can’t login to respond to the enquiry.  Please can you send us the details.  If this is a paid subscription then you can unsubscribe us, I’m afraid we have no further budget for directories as we’ve just closed our budget for this academic year.  If it is a free listing, then we’d be happy to work with you.
