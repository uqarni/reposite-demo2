Great to connect with you! High level, {reseller_org_name} is looking for a staffing provider for a group of {group_size} in {destination} for {trip_dates} next year. Since you're already on our basic free plan, you should be able to view the full request and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by logging into your Reposite account. Let me know if you run into any trouble accessing.

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships (average group size on Reposite last month was 72), I'd highly recommend considering our full membership program. It gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}

","Hi John,

Great to connect with you! Smith Co, a professional planner, is organizing a group trip for 50 members in Honolulu from August 10, 2023, to August 20, 2023. They're looking for reliable travel suppliers and used Reposite to reach out for a quote. The request was sent to you, and you can view it and directly respond to the planner by logging into your Reposite account. Do let me know if you run into any issues accessing it.

By the way, as a user on our basic plan, you can receive leads like this one. However, if you're interested in receiving more leads and building long-term relationships with travel and event planners, I'd suggest considering our full membership program.

Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I donâ€™t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if thereâ€™s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didnâ€™t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction iâ€™ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. Iâ€™m excited at the prospect!!

","Taylor,
Thanks for getting back to me; I'm curious if anyone has ever said no to your follow-up question!
Frankly, Iâ€™m not entirely sure how our connection through your platform came about, considering I didnâ€™t initially set it up. However, having explored it and finding it to seem credible, I went ahead and set up a cocktail class portal to gauge any possible traction.
I appreciate the availability of a free tier option from you guys, and I understand you want to move us to a premium tier. I'm cautious due to a prior unpleasant experience with WeddingWire a few years ago. They lured me into signing up by dispatching a sham request immediately post-sign-up. During my 6-month with their premium tier, not a single genuine lead materialized, and the cost was significantly higher. This situation is a little similar, so once I get some traction, I'll be open to exploring pricing for elevated tiers. Excited to see where it goes!
Cheers,

","Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-upâ€”it came from a genuine customer! 

At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 

And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. 

You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration 
That said, can I help point you towards any other resources or information to better understand how Reposite can benefit your business? 
Cheers, 
Taylor","Hey John,

I totally understand your caution based on past experience with other platforms. Trust me, we're not like them. We're genuinely thrilled about the interest in your awesome cocktail classes and we love when our community grows with unique, high-quality suppliers like Acme Trading Co! 

Consider this: the average size of groups planning through Reposite is 72, and interest in the Honolulu area has been booming! On the basic plan you are on, you're only seeing a fraction of potential leads. Our full membership unlocks access to unlimited connections and tools to help you reach professional planners interested in what you offer. 

Given your concerns, I feel it's really important to reinforce that we won't put you under any financial pressure - the first lead is complimentary, and no, we're not sending sham requests. The interest from Smith Co. is very real! After this, you only owe commission if you are awarded the booking.

Of course, the decision is ultimately yours John, but given your interest in traction, I believe our membership, which gives you unlimited leads for a full year and waives all commissions, would be a game-changer for you. 

With that said, do you have a strategy already in place to build a more consistent pipeline of group business, or is this an area you'd like to grow?

Best,

Taylor

Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! 
Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 
In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 
The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. 
Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 
Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 
Best, 
Taylor","Hello John,

I'd love to clear any confusion. Tim Cotter is on our team and helps suppliers like Acme Trading Co, to utilize Reposite's features effectively. Consider me as another guide on your Reposite journey, focused on ensuring you understand and maximize the opportunities our platform provides, especially our full membership program. 

Regarding commissions, with our basic (free) plan, when you make a booking, a commission fee applies. However, if you upgrade to our full membership program, all commissions are waived for a year. This membership at $500 annually can significantly expand your visibility and interactions with travel and event planners.

We aim to foster meaningful, long-term relationships that deliver consistent business. If you wish to get a detailed overview of our membership program and its benefits, feel free to refer to this link: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1.

"Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. Iâ€™ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. Thatâ€™s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping iâ€™m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

","Understood. So, securing a membership would negate a 15% commission, among other perks, and it seems like the premium tiers get an early advantage as well. I'll stay engaged in the ecosystem to gauge any traction I might generate. The crucial distinction between free and premium tiers here appears to be the incentive to maximize any forged connections versus not achieving any progress, in which case there'd be no incentive to upgrade. I hope that's clear.
Moving forward, particularly on your platform, my objective is to sell cocktail classes and be available for any requisite craft cocktail/mixology catering events. Thatâ€™s our specialty, and we are super good at it! I'm hopeful to offer these to future customers.

Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense â€“ Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. 
Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 
{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 
Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 
Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan. 
OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings.

","Hi John,

That's wonderful news to hear. Just to give you some clarity, you're currently on the basic plan of Reposite and I can understand why you'd like to gauge the potential first before investing in the membership.

But did you know, members on our platform get a complete 24-hour head start to respond to all inquiries? This holds importance as over half of the bookings are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first day. Thus, being on basic plan puts you at a slight disadvantage. 

Also, while OpenTable is fantastic for B2C engagements, our Reposite membership is purposely built to help suppliers like Acme Trading Co connect with professional travel and event planners. Thereby, creating consistent group business.

","Hi John,

Appreciate your response and the information provided. I've made a note of this, and will make sure future communication is directed accordingly.

However, if you're interested in gaining more visibility and control over your business engagements with planners, I'd like to recommend our Membership program. It offers a suite of features designed to help you grow your business with unlimited leads for a full year, waiving all commissions/add-ons, and providing tools to build lasting partnerships with event and travel planners.

","Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite. As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network.

","Hello John,

No worries at all. That said, you can freely share and discuss the quotes you receive via Reposite with your team. That's completely okay. 

Just to clarify, the membership isn't for individual use, but for Acme Trading Co as a whole. It's designed to open up a world of possibilities in the form of countless leads from an ever-growing network of professional travel & event planners, which could amplify your business significantly. 

It might be worth having a conversation with the authority figures in your company about this fruitful opportunity. You can find all the details about our membership program here: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1 

Who in Acme Trading Co do you think might be interested to know more about this?

Great to hear from you! While it's delightful to see that you're ready to send out a quote, it's important to get properly connected first. Right now, you're on our basic free plan where you have limited access to handle inbound requests. 
In order to fully utilize the platform and enjoy unlimited access to all inbound leads, you can upgrade to a full Reposite membership which will support your efforts in creating long term relationships with travel and event planners. You can review the membership perks here: {membership_link}

Taylor","Hey John,

Thanks for your quick response!

Our platform at Reposite is all about connecting planners and suppliers like you with direct opportunities like this one. Your offer of $800 for a 4 hour minibar service sounds exciting. However, I'm merely the messenger here. To make sure your offer reaches Smith Co smoothly, simply follow this next step:

Make sure you're responding directly to the message you received from Smith Co in your Reposite account. That way, they'll get your data immediately and can move forward appropriately.

And while you're on there, have you considered upgrading your Reposite account to a full membership? Smith Co is just one example of the countless planners on our platform who are often looking for quality travel suppliers in Honolulu.

With a full membership, you get unlimited access to these types of leads, access to in-person networking events & virtual meet and greets, and a ton more benefits that will help you connect with even more potential business opportunities.

","Hey John,

I completely get where you're coming from. However, it's essential to underline that our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and Honolulu has been buzzing with activities lately. 

The membership is primarily designed for travel suppliers like Acme Trading Co who are keen to build a more consistent pipeline of group business via our network of professional B2B planners. These planners prefer to engage directly, saving you from the hassle of submitting forms or leaving voice mails on individual business websites!

Since you were invited by a planner on the platform, you qualify for the $500 annual rate, which is the lowest available.

Seems like you have a system in place, but I do have to say that this is likely preventing you from receiving consistent group business from B2B professional travel and event planners. That model generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, theyâ€™re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.

","Hi John,

Certainly! I appreciate the details about your collaboration process. Reposite is a B2B marketplace designed to help streamline the connection process between travel and event planners and suppliers like Acme Trading Co.

The recent interest from Smith Co is a complimentary feature that assists you in growing your business. However, I would strongly recommend shopping our $500 annual membership. It offers unlimited access to leads, waivers on all commissions for members for the year, priority access to in-person networking events, and virtual meet and greets.

It won't take much time to manage and it could potentially produce a massive return for Acme Trading Co. You can learn more about membership benefits here: https://www.reposite.io/membership-overview-1.

","Hi John,

I fully understand and appreciate your candidness. The glory of Reposite lies in our mission to help providers like Acme Trading Co establish meaningful and lasting relationships with a variety of professional planners organizing trips to Honolulu and beyond. 

These professional planners value Reposite as an important tool for optimizing their group planning process, and often, they won't reach out directly, as it can be cumbersome to manually engage with every aspect of an itinerary on various business websites.

Our membership program, which I must mention you qualify for at the lowest available annual rate of $500, unlocks a plethora of benefits which ultimately aids in the growth and stability of your group business. This includes unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waived commission on all earned bookings for a year, and countless opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries to source new travel services.
