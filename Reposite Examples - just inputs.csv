"Hi Taylor,
Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.

Thanks, {lead_first_name}"

"Good Morning Taylor, Can this be made within monthly payments? Can you please explain how your platform works?"


"Hello Taylor,
At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.
Would you happen to know if you have any training courses? At the same time, I was wondering how I could get a receipt for the last charge I placed on my credit Card.
Cheers,
{lead_first_name} Plumb"


"Good morning Taylor,

In order to quote please provide the following information:
What date would be your activity?
Time of the activity.
Duration of the activity.
Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.

Best,

Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
I popped over to the we

"Taylor, 
Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

"Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

"Hello, 
We basically work with other companies like below:
1- You can email us the trip details and we can let you know our availability. 
2- Then if you would like to proceed, we will input the reservations and sent you confirmation emails and a CC form. 
3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking  after receiving the CC.
4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and  pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.
Have a good day.
