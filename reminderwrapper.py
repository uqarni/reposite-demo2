    A follow-up is NOT warranted if:
    (1) the user has indicated that they are not interested or are unhappy in some way. For example, they have said that they are not interested in the product or do not want to be contacted.
    (2) the user has indicated that they already purchased the Reposite membership.
    

    Otherwise, a follow-up is warranted.
