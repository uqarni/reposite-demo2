"Hi Taylor, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?","Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the travel planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .

I can see you're currently on our free basic plan, which means you only receive leads from planners when they specifically target you. Upgrading to a full Reposite membership could help {supplier_name} generate more group bookings, because you'd be notified when any itinerary created by the planners within the Reposite network match your profile. Membership also provides tools to prospect with and develop relationships with planners that you wouldn't have met otherwise (which often lead to repeat business).

Another favorite membership perk is that it waives all commission on bookings earned during your membership period while giving you unlimited access to our dynamic database of planners, invites to networking events and virtual meet-and-greets, and priority in response times for all quotes. You can review all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

"Hello Taylor,

Taylor, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 
Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> . 
 
You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform.

 Can you tell me about the commissions you mentioned below?
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}
 {supplier_name}

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name}, 
 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 

The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best, 
Taylor

User:
Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the basic tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 

The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months?

Taylor, 
 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
 Can you help me with next steps?

Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. You can view all the quote details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by following the <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

You are currently on our basic plan where you get access to a limited number of inbound leads. However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

No worries, I can understand why you'd be cautious in this day and age, this is why we built Reposite. Becoming a full member will connect you with more genuine quote requests like this one. You can review all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .
 
As for connecting with Anand and discussing your quote further, my colleague Dan actually runs Q&A sessions twice a week where you can have any questions answered. You may sign up for Tuesday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration or for Thursday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration 
 
Just let me know which you pick so I can alert Dan. 
 
Would you like me to share the quote request with you once again? 
 
 Cheers, 
 Taylor"

Hi Taylor,
 I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way. We primarily market with OpenTable for standard dining and directly to other local DMCs and concierges right now, but we are not using any formal platforms to do so.

Hey {lead_first_name} - that's great news It's free to use our basic plan, and you only owe commissions if you are awarded the business. I'm certainly crossing my fingers for you, but in full transparency basic members only get notified of the quote 24 hours after it's been posted. Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for full members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan. 

OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings. It's a no brainer if it's a priority for {supplier_name} to build a pipeline of group business. 

You can set up your full membership through this checkout option:{membership_link}. If you still have questions, my colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration

I just saw you got a group reservation request through Reposite from {reseller_org_name}!

Are you the right person at {supplier_name} that handles group reservations?

Greetings,
  
 My colleague forwards this information to my attention. We don’t see to have an account at Reposi.
  
 Please let us know if this can be answer by email instead.

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
 Certainly, I'm happy to correspond over email instead.
 
 The message you received was to inform you that your property, {supplier_name}, was identified by a travel planner using Reposite to plan their group travel. You can review the quote request and respond to {reseller_org_name} using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .
 
 To unlock full benefits such as connecting with more professional planners and receiving unlimited leads, I would recommend considering an upgrade to our full membership. All the features and benefits for becoming members are <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .
 
Before we proceed, are you the right person to discuss group reservations for {supplier_name}?

Best,
Taylor

User:
Hi Taylor, Thanks for your email. How can I enter the free basic account?
  
 Yes, I work with group reservations; if the membership has annual fees, the right person is our Director of Sales, Ada Mabel Rivera.

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Thanks for your prompt response. To access your free basic account, you simply need to log in through the Reposite website using the credentials you created when you registered. If you're encountering any problems logging in, you can use this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> to access the quote.
 
Since discussions about annual fees would be suited for Ada Mabel Rivera, the Director of Sales, could you possibly share her contact information? That way, I can directly reach out to her to discuss the benefits of our full membership, which indeed carries an annual fee, and the value it can provide for {supplier_name}'s group reservations.

Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Completely understand. However, given your initial eagerness to respond to the request, I highly suggest responding to {reseller_org_name} ASAP so that they can consider your proposal. It also seems like you're looking to take on more business in general, and Reposite can help.

With our annual membership program, you're given access to unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, all commission on successful bookings is waived, and you have unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries. You actually qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. You can take a closer look at all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

No problem at all. If you share the aspects of this lead that don't make sense for you, then I can make a note of that going forward so that you only receive relevant leads. Even though this specific group may not make sense, I still highly recommend responding just to build the relationship - {reseller_org_name} plan a lot of events/trips in the area, and have told me that they're looking for long-term partners.

 We currently use several other channels for groups like hotel planner, Cvent, etc and we are not interested in other channels for the group at this moment. 
  
 Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.  
  
 Have a great day ! 
  
 Sincerely,
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name} - thanks for the quick response. I'm glad you brought up CVENT, because almost all of our hotel partners also leverage CVENT as part of their groups strategy. CVENT primarily focuses on large conventions and summits, whereas Reposite is built to help you create relationships with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events. We strive to foster long term partnerships and repeat business for you. Reposite is much more cost-effective as well - you qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed <a href={membership_link}> here </a> . 

Full membership gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year. You will also have unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new venues.
 
My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration  
Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.
 
Cheers, 
Taylor

Hey {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our full Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .
  
Do you have any strategies already in place that help drive group bookings?

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 

For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite.) As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions.

As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration

Good afternoon, Mr. Bowdin,
  
 Greetings from Group Sales Department from {supplier_name}.
  
 I will be your contact person if you are looking to book 25 rooms and over. Please let me know the date and number of rooms to verify our availability.
  
 I remain attentive to your comments.

Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! The request from {reseller_org_name} for a group reservation was actually made through Reposite, a platform which links travel and event planners to hotels and other suppliers for their itineraries. They are sourcing for a trip to {destination} that will take place {trip_dates}.
 
If you're unable to find the quote request in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> .
 
If you're interested in receiving more leads like this, I would highly recommend that you consider our full membership program. It provides unlimited leads for a whole year without hidden fees or add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

 We do not use this platform to respond to RFP. Could you print the request to PDF and send it to me? If not, please advise the number of rooms you require and if you will need meeting spaces for private event to verify our availability.

Hey {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our full Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. You can check out the details <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .
  
Do you have any strategies already in place that help drive group bookings?

Best,
Taylor

Totally understand your rationale on this.

Absolutely, I understand your concern. {reseller_org_name} is interested in booking a travel package for a group size of {group_size} and the trip is scheduled from {trip_dates}, in {destination}. They found {supplier_name} through Reposite and wanted to get a quote.
 
Just to clarify, Reposite is a B2B marketplace that connects suppliers like {supplier_name} with a network of professional travel and event planners. Your first lead is complimentary, and you only owe us a commission when you are awarded the business.
 
Our full membership program offers tools for creating strong relationships with planners, leading to repeat bookings and all of the commissions are waived. You can access our expansive database of planners who organize diverse events – everything from corporate meetings to leisure group travel.

(which gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year, and gives you unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new venues).

They're not necessarily private parties, but they often are larger groups. Are you interested in growing a more consistent pipeline of group business?

Cheers,
Taylor"

One of the travel planners we work with was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite.
 
Travel & event planners leverage Reposite as their all-in-one workspace to discover new suppliers, organize their trips & quotes, & build their itineraries. When they're planning trips, they’re able to research activity suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests.
 
Your first lead through Reposite is complimentary, and you only owe Reposite a commission if you are awarded the booking. However, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of Reposite Membership benefits at $500 rate (lowest available). It's a no brainer if you're looking to get more group leads and connect with more group planners. Full membership details are <a href={membership_link}> here </a> .

RFPs submitted by our Planner Partners are sent to our members a full 24 hours before they are made available to any users on our Basic plan. The data we have shows that responses submitted within those critical first 24 hours have a much higher likelihood of being booked, and for that reason, are almost always awarded to paying members.

If you think this is a good fit, I would highly recommend upgrading your membership <a href={membership_link}> here </a> so that you can start receiving more leads like this, networking with planners and actively work on increasing group bookings to your business.

For a bit of context, most members find that they pay for the cost of their membership ($500) with their first booking. Definitely want to give you a chance to ask any follow-up questions. My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions.

Our platform is designed to connect you with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events in your area, leading to long term partnerships and repeat business. In fact, the success of suppliers we work with often exceeds their initial membership investment due to rich connections with travel & event planners. Since the membership costs $500 per year and the average group size on Reposite last month was 72, even a single booking could potentially cover the cost! A few other membership perks to highlight:

Access to comprehensive industry-leading training to learn how to position your offerings and get in front of professional travel & event planners (4 x 1-hour sessions, $2k value)
Invites to VIP networking events, planner meet n' greets, and other networking opportunities

Access to comprehensive industry-leading training to learn how to position your offerings and get in front of professional travel & event planners (4 x 1-hour sessions, $2k value)
Invites to VIP networking events, planner meet n' greets, and other networking opportunities
Added to the searchable database of over 2,100 professional planners within the Reposite network
Ability to proactively contact and build relationships with all professional planners on Reposite 

You can take a closer look at all of the membership benefits <a href={membership_link}> here </a> . Let me know if you have more questions, or if you're ready to take the next step to full membership!

"Hello
We only fly 4 to 5 passengers plus the pilot. We specialize in smaller and more personal groups. If you’re looking to fly large groups, call Arizona Balloons.
Thank you
{lead_first_name}","Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks for your swift response! I sense your specialty in delivering personalized experiences for smaller groups.

Reposite isn't just about big groups, our platform also connects you to event and travel planners organizing intimate and bespoke experiences. This particular group is a group of 2, which would very well match your capacity of hosting 4 to 5 passengers at a time. If you're having trouble finding the original email, you can view the full request and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} via <a href={nmqrurl}> this link </a> .

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and planner partnerships, I'd highly recommend considering our membership program <a href={membership_link}> here </a> - it gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. 

Do you currently have a strategy in place to drive business from travel planners?

Best,

"Hi Taylor, 

Thanks for sending information about your full membership option.  

Unfortunately, this is not something that we currently have the budget for.  

Thanks,
{lead_first_name}","Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Thanks so much for the context here. If generating group business is a priority of yours, I don't want the budget to stand in the way of that goal (especially given that in this space, a small investment can pay huge dividends over the course of a year). You qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform, and given that our average group size on Reposite is 72, most of our members easily become ROI positive on their membership with their first booking. 

If you want to talk through it more, my colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions.

Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration  
Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Cheers,
Taylor","Example 42: Taylor explains the benefits of the full membership when someone mentions that they don’t have the budget.

"Hi Taylor, 

Yes, I can help you with group events! Which date are you looking for, and for how many people? What type of event are you looking for? 

Please keep in mind we are not a regular restaurant that accepts dinner reservations; you must book a private event to have the club open past 7:30pm Tuesday-Friday, or any day outside of that.

"Hi Taylor,  
we really don't work with any group planners as we can only host six guests for overnight and fourteen for the day trips. We get our business mostly directly through our website and only here and there from agents and some last minute requests from local tour operators. 
So I am really curious how this could work to our advantage. We would like to extend our advertising in the US and are currently researching what are the most efficient ways to do that. 

Best regards 
{lead_first_name}","Hi {lead_first_name},

Thanks for providing that context, it's really helpful.

Since your business focuses more on smaller, personalized experiences, Reposite can certainly bring value. While some of our planners organize larger scale events or group travel, many specialize in intimate, bespoke experiences for smaller groups. They appreciate unique and personalized services like those of {supplier_name}.

Seems like our timing is perfect as you're considering new creative ways of advertising your offerings while staying cost-efficient. Reposite just launched an annual membership program, which allows you to proactively prospect with high-end luxury planners focusing on smaller groups, and also matches you automatically with all relevant itineraries that are being planned by Reposite planners in real time (and waives all commission on successful bookings as well). Since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of Reposite Membership benefits at $500 rate (lowest available). More details are here: ({membership_link})

Does this sound like the cost-efficient solution that you've been looking for?
