"Hi Taylor,
 Yes we did receive a request! Thanks for reaching out.
 My name is {lead_first_name} and I'll be your point of contact for scheduling group reservations. Currently awaiting a response from Tim Cotter at Reposite before finalizing a quote for you. Let me know if you need anything else from our side regarding setting up future events/group reservations.
 
Thanks, {lead_first_name}"
"Good Morning Taylor, Can this be made within monthly payments? Can you please explain how your platform works?"
"Hello Taylor,
 At present, we are looking for some additional partners to expand our market. In the past, we were ideally suited to groups as we have a majority of 2 Bed (Queen Size Rooms). A past colleague introduced us to Reposite however, I am not sure if I am using your application to its fullest.
 Would you happen to know if you have any training courses? At the same time, I was wondering how I could get a receipt for the last charge I placed on my credit Card.
 Cheers,
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}"
"Good morning Taylor,
 

 In order to quote please provide the following information:
 What date would be your activity?
 Time of the activity.
 Duration of the activity.
 Do you want three courses and beverages? or cocktail/butler style service? (meaning abundant food will be passed by during the event)
 I'll be sending you a link with a video of our restaurant for your reference.
 

 Best,

"Taylor, 
 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
 Can you help me with next steps? 
 Cheers,
 

 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}
 {supplier_name}"
"Taylor, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!! 
 Cheers,

"I have gotten messages from multiple people, I don’t know who my representative would be. The newest person is Tim Cotter. Happy to provide honest feedback, us business owners tend to be that way sometimes! 
 Can you tell me about the commissions you mentioned below?
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}
 {supplier_name}"
"Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

 Thanks, yes I am the correct contact for group reservations.

 I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way.

"Hi Taylor,
Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your warm words regarding our presence on Reposite and the opportunity with {reseller_org_name}.

To provide some insight into our ideal type of group business, we have a strong track record of successfully working with a diverse range of clients, including students, wedding groups, and international groups. We pride ourselves on delivering exceptional experiences tailored to each client's unique needs.

I'd also like to highlight that we have our own fleet of buses, which allows us to ensure top-notch transportation services for our clients. Furthermore, we hold permits for exclusive experiences, such as the bioluminescent bay night kayaking tour, access to El Yunque National Forest, and meet-and-greet services inside the airport terminal. It's important to note that we don't subcontract our services because we are the direct providers, which enables us to maintain strict quality control and a seamless customer experience.

We look forward to exploring potential opportunities on Reposite.

"Hi Taylor,
Thank you for your prompt response and for your kind words about {supplier_name}. I'm glad to hear that our offerings align well with your planners network.
I appreciate your recommendation to consider upgrading to a full membership. I'll definitely take a closer look at the membership benefits you've provided in the link. It's essential for us to maximize our visibility and connections within your network, so this option seems promising.
We're very interested in upgrading to a full membership, but we'd like to work with our first group first to ensure everything aligns as expected. Once we've had a successful experience with our initial engagement, we'll proceed with the membership to leverage the full benefits of your network.
Currently, we rely on a mix of tools and resources for sourcing group business, including industry-specific forums, social media platforms, and some partnerships with local event planning associations. However, we're always open to exploring new avenues that can help us expand our reach and enhance our business development efforts.
I'll review the membership details and discuss it further with my team to make an informed decision. Thanks again for your guidance and support.

"Hi Taylor,  
we really don't work with any group planners as we can only host six guests for overnight and fourteen for the day trips. We get our business mostly directly through our website and only here and there from agents and some last minute requests from local tour operators. 
So I am really curious how this could work to our advantage. We would like to extend our advertising in the US and are currently researching what are the most efficient ways to do that.
