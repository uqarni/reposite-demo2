Hi Taylor, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the travel planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing suppliers via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, create your profile, and respond to this lead within Reposite. (For non-members, we charge a small 15% commission on all successful bookings.) 

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request.

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. 

Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help.

 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business.

 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name}, 
 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount.

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best, 
Taylor

User:
Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}
 {supplier_name}

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about? 

Cheers, 
Taylor

 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.  
 Can you help me with next steps?

Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. You can view all the quote details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by following the <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> . 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. 

Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help.

Taylor, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first.

I have gotten messages from multiple people, I don’t know who my representative would be. The newest person is Tim Cotter. Happy to provide honest feedback, us business owners tend to be that way sometimes! 
 Can you tell me about the commissions you mentioned below?

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name}, 
 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount.

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best, 
Taylor

User:
Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

You can view the details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> .
Under Organization Name make sure to enter it as "" {supplier_name} "" this will ensure you are brought directly to the quote request
You can also sign up from the original lead email, <a href={nmqr_signup_video}> this video </a> walks you through that process.
 
As for connecting with Anand and discussing your quote further, my colleague Dan actually runs Q&A sessions twice a week where you can have any questions answered. You may sign up for Tuesday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration or for Thursday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration 
 
Just let me know which you pick so I can alert Dan. 
 
 Cheers, 
 Taylor

Hi Taylor,
 I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way. We primarily market with OpenTable for standard dining and directly to other local DMCs and concierges right now, but we are not using any formal platforms to do so.

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name} - that's great news It's free to use our basic plan, and you only owe commissions if you are awarded the business. I'm certainly crossing my fingers for you, but in full transparency basic members only get notified of the quote 24 hours after it's been posted. Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for full members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan. 

OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings. It's a no brainer if it's a priority for {supplier_name} to build a pipeline of group business. 

You can set up your membership and respond to this quote request through<a href={nmqrurl}> this link </a> . If you still have questions, my colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration

No problem at all. If you share the aspects of this lead that don't make sense for you, then I can make a note of that going forward so that you only receive relevant leads. Even though this specific group may not make sense, I still highly recommend responding just to build the relationship - {reseller_org_name} plan a lot of events/trips in the area, and have told me that they're looking for long-term partners.

Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! The request from {reseller_org_name} for a group reservation was actually made through Reposite, a platform which links travel and event planners to hotels and other suppliers for their itineraries. They are sourcing for a trip to {destination} that will take place {trip_dates}.
 
You can get in touch directly with the planner by following the instructions below:

You can view the details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} <a href={nmqrurl}> here </a> .
Under Organization Name make sure to enter it as "" {supplier_name} "" this will ensure you are brought directly to the quote request
You can also sign up from the original lead email, <a href={nmqr_signup_video}> this video </a> walks you through that process

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Dear Tylor,
  
 I hope this email finds you well.
  
 We do not use this platform to respond to RFP. Could you print the request to PDF and send it to me? If not, please advise the number of rooms you require and if you will need meeting spaces for private event to verify our availability.

Hey {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this <a href={nmqrurl}> link </a> .. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings.

Best,
Taylor

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).

Totally understand your rationale on this. It's worth noting that our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the {destination} area in the past few months. So membership is really only designed for providers who are wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business via B2B planners. Most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).

Thank you but I have no interest in paying for a membership to receive work.

Assistant:
Totally understand your rationale on this. It's worth noting that our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the {destination} area in the past few months. So membership is really only designed for providers who are wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business via B2B planners. Most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 
 
My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration  

Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.
