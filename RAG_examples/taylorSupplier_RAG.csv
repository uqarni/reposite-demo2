You can sign up your email to be connected to your account with Reposite by signing up via this <a href={signup_link}> link </a>. The only way to communicate directly with {reseller_org_name} would be through the platform.

For a little more context as to why this is so important - for our planner partners: corporate meeting planners, destination management companies, incentive groups, etc, use Reposite as their all in one workspace. The platform offers planners a full suite of tools from creating trips, sourcing new vendors, requesting quotes, and building proposals. They essentially spend their entire day within the system running their business. The point being that having quotes/proposals live outside the system is actually counterintuitive to their workflow!
