"Hi Taylor, this is {lead_first_name}. What can I help you with?","Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Great to connect with you! Can definitely help provide some clarity here. One of the travel planners we work with {reseller_org_name} was sourcing {category}s via our Quote Request tool for their trip in {destination} for {group_size} people, and after doing some research you looked like a great fit so they reached out through Reposite. The request was originally sent to {email}, but if you're unable to find it in your inbox, you can view it and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} on this link {nmqrurl} 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite. (For our basic plan, we charge a small 15% commission on all successful bookings.) 

The first lead is complimentary, but if you're interested in receiving more leads and group planner partnerships (average group size on Reposite last month was 72), I'd highly recommend considering our full membership program. It gives unlimited leads for a full year with no hidden fees or commissions / add-ons. You can review all of the membership benefits here: {membership_link}

Have you been looking to grow your groups business?

Taylor, 
 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 
Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business. 
 
You might find it interesting to check out one of our webinars where we discuss how to get the most out of the platform. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration

I have gotten messages from multiple people, I don’t know who my representative would be. The newest person is Tim Cotter. Happy to provide honest feedback, us business owners tend to be that way sometimes! 
 Can you tell me about the commissions you mentioned below?
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}
 {supplier_name}

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name}, 
 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 

The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best, 
Taylor

User:
Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

 Frankly, I’m not entirely sure how our connection through your platform came about, considering I didn’t initially set it up. However, having explored it and finding it to seem credible, I went ahead and set up a cocktail class portal to gauge any possible traction.
 I appreciate the availability of a free tier option from you guys, and I understand you want to move us to a premium tier. I'm cautious due to a prior unpleasant experience with WeddingWire a few years ago. They lured me into signing up by dispatching a sham request immediately post-sign-up. During my 6-month with their premium tier, not a single genuine lead materialized, and the cost was significantly higher. This situation is a little similar, so once I get some traction, I'll be open to exploring pricing for elevated tiers. Excited to see where it goes!
 Cheers,

 Thanks for your response and your willingness to share honest feedback - it's greatly appreciated and helps us constantly improve! Tim is indeed part of our onboarding team which assists with first quote requests, while I'm your point of contact for membership. 

In terms of our commission, with the free tier, if you were to win a booking from a quote request sent via Reposite, we would collect a 15% commission from the final billed amount. However, the benefit of our full membership (for an annual rate of $500) is that all commissions on bookings are completely waived for a year. This rate is our lowest available given that you've been invited by a planner on the platform. 

The full membership also includes amplified visibility to our network of over 2,100 group travel and event planners, unlimited access to respond to all RFPs, and higher ranking of responses on all RFPs. Additionally, members get to utilize our tools and resources to proactively shape and expand their planner partnerships. Compared to free tier users, full members get a 24 hour head start to submit quotes and respond - an advantage given that approximately 50% of all bookings on Reposite are awarded to the suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours. 

Are there specific goals you have in mind for your group business in the coming months? 

Best,

 Hey, just getting back into town. Apologies on the delayed response. Did I at some point sign up for Reposite or do you guys search for specific vendor types in a given area? 
 I popped over to the website and saw the request come through, we can totally put something together for them. We have a couple different cocktail classes we put together that are an absolute blast every time.

Hey {lead_first_name}, 

Nice to hear back from you! I'm glad you're excited about the quote request. To answer your question, the planner found {supplier_name} on our platform and thought you would be a good fit for their group. You can view all the quote details and respond directly to {reseller_org_name} by following the link: {nmqrurl} 

There’s no cost to sign up for our basic free plan, where you can create your profile and respond to this lead. You also get access to a limited number of inbound leads with this basic plan. However, to fully engage with our planner network, broaden your reach and receive unlimited leads from our 2,100+ professional planners, I'd recommend our full membership program. In addition to connecting with a wide network of planners, our membership waives all commissions and fees for a full year. You can check out the details here: {membership_link}

Let me know if you run into any logging in to see this request, I’d be glad to help. Have you been wanting to grow your groups business?

 Thanks for responding, I wonder if anyone has ever answered no to your follow up question!! 
 So to be honest, I don’t 100% understand how I got connected with you guys, example how I got onto your platform initially without setting it up. That said, I did look at it, it seems reputable so I set up a cocktail class portal on there to see if there’s any traction. 
 I am happy you guys have a free tiered option, and I also totally understand that the main goal is to get people into the premium tier. I am apprehensive because a few years back I got burned pretty bad with WeddingWire. They tricked me into signing up by sending a fake request right after I signed up which gave me a false affirmation that I made a good decision. In the 6 or so months I was on their premium tier I didn’t get a single real lead and it cost a lot of money. This feels a little bit the same, so if/when I get any type of real traction i’ll be comfortable with looking at pricing for higher tiers. I’m excited at the prospect!!

Thanks for your honest feedback! We understand how crucial it is to build trust with our members, and that's why transparency is paramount to us. Actually, the quote request you received was not a set-up—it came from a genuine customer! 
 
At Reposite, our mission is to facilitate valuable connections between vendors, like {supplier_name}, and our extensive network of travel & event planners. We strive to foster long-term partnerships that lead to repeat business for your company. We're not a public listing site, so through Reposite, you'll be connected with trusted and vetted planners that can bring you a consistent group business. 
 
And for sure, feel free to explore our basic level first. However, bear in mind that our full membership program provides unlimited leads, networking events, and waived off commissions, among other perks. It can essentially be seen as a toolbox to supercharge your group business.

Ok got it. So a membership would waive a 15% commission among having other benefits. It sounds like premium tiers have a head start as well. I’ll stay in the ecosystem to see what kind of traction if any I can generate by posting on Reposite. The big difference from free to premium here will be the motivation to maximize any connections that are made vs getting no movement in which case there would be no motivation to move up. Hope that makes sense. 
 My goal moving forward especially with your platform would be to sell cocktail classes and be available for any craft cocktail/mixology catering events that are needed. That’s what we do and we do it very well! Hoping i’m able to provide these great services to people looking for exactly that!

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 Your approach sounds spot-on! And it absolutely makes sense – Reposite is essentially the stage for suppliers to represent their unique offerings to our network of planners. Your world-class cocktail classes and craft catering that take the spotlight. Staying in the ecosystem and gauging the traction is a sensible first step. A full membership comes with more visibility and outreach prospects, but seeing the value firsthand can help make that decision more clear cut. 

{supplier_name}'s services bring a lot of value to a variety of group events and trips, and we'd love to provide you with an avenue to reach those who are searching exactly for what you offer. Also, should you decide to move up to premium, that 15% commission is waived which is a big thumbs up! 

Remember, you can always reach out to us for any questions or assistance. We are excited to see the connections you'll make here at Reposite. 

Do you currently have any upcoming cocktail classes or events that you are particularly excited about?

Hey {lead_first_name}, 
 
 Great to hear from you and I'm glad you're the right person to discuss group reservations with. 
 
No worries, I can understand why you'd be cautious in this day and age, this is why we built Reposite. Becoming a full member will connect you with more genuine quote requests like this one. I've included the link if you'd like to explore that more: {membership_link} 
 
As for connecting with Anand and discussing your quote further, my colleague Dan actually runs Q&A sessions twice a week where you can have any questions answered. You may sign up for Tuesday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration or for Thursday's session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration 
 
Just let me know which you pick so I can alert Dan. 
 
Would you like me to share the quote request with you once again? 
 
 Cheers, 
 Taylor","Hello Taylor,
 

 Thank you; yes, I am the appropriate contact for group reservations.
 I had reservations about your quote email from 9/20/23... fearing it was spam, I just didn't click on it.
 

 I attempted to call Anand at 234 664-0784 and left messages.
 

 Kindly text me at 356 987-1443, and I will return your call right away.
 

 I'm hopeful we can make some music together!

Hi Taylor,
 I spoke with our team and they approved me to sign up for the Membership once it looks like we will get a booking. For now, we will wait it out and see what comes our way. We primarily market with OpenTable for standard dining and directly to other local DMCs and concierges right now, but we are not using any formal platforms to do so.

Assistant:
Hey {lead_first_name} - that's great news It's free to use our basic plan, and you only owe commissions if you are awarded the business. I'm certainly crossing my fingers for you, but in full transparency basic members only get notified of the quote 24 hours after it's been posted. Given that over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to suppliers who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry (the head start is a perk only reserved for full members), you're at a bit of a disadvantage if you stay on the basic plan. 

OpenTable is great for B2C business, but the Reposite membership is designed to bring consistent group business from professional travel and event planners (our average group size stands at 72 currently). Brendan & Anand may have already mentioned this, but it's worth noting that since you were identified by a planner through Reposite, you actually qualify for a full year of membership at the $500 annual rate (lowest available), which also waives all commissions from successful bookings. It's a no brainer if it's a priority for {supplier_name} to build a pipeline of group business. 

You can set up your membership through this checkout option:{membership_link}. If you still have questions, my colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week.

Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Thank you for letting me know about the update. I'll ensure all future group business leads come to you directly. Also, thanks for pointing out the issue about only seeing an old 2022 lead on our platform - looks like the newest request wasn't connecting with your existing account, so I'll flag this to my team and make sure that it appears in your quotes dashboard. 
 
It's free to sign up for our basic plan. However, {category}s that are on our full membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses plus all commissions from successful bookings are waived for members as well (Full membership perks details for your reference here: {membership_link}). The 24 hour lead time is valuable, since statistically over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to {category}s who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Definitely worth considering if you wanted to get serious about growing a pipeline of group business from travel and event planners.
 
Are you currently leveraging any platforms or tools to drive more consistent group business your way?

 All leads should flow to me not Edita. I handle all group business. 
 Also, when I log on your platform, I only see an old 2022 lead. Nothing current. 
 Warm Regards,
 {lead_first_name} {lead_last_name}

Assistant:
Hi {lead_first_name},
 
Thank you for letting me know about the update. I'll ensure all future group business leads come to you directly. Also, thanks for pointing out the issue about only seeing an old 2022 lead on our platform - looks like the newest request wasn't connecting with your existing account, so I'll flag this to my team and make sure that it appears in your quotes dashboard. 
 
It's free to sign up for our basic plan. However, {category}s that are on our full membership plan automatically get a 24 hour head start on responses plus all commissions from successful bookings are waived for members as well (Full membership perks details for your reference here: {membership_link}). The 24 hour lead time is valuable, since statistically over half of the bookings on Reposite are awarded to {category}s who respond within the first 24 hours of an inquiry. Definitely worth considering if you wanted to get serious about growing a pipeline of group business from travel and event planners.
 
Are you currently leveraging any platforms or tools to drive more consistent group business your way?

Best, 
Taylor","Hello Taylor,
 

 Please direct all leads to me, not Jeremy, as I manage all group business.
 Additionally, when I access your platform, I only see an old lead from 2022 and nothing up to date.

CVENT primarily focuses on large conventions and summits, whereas Reposite is built to help you create relationships with travel and event professionals who are consistently planning group trips and events. We strive to foster long term partnerships and repeat business for you. Reposite is much more cost-effective as well - you qualify for the $500 annual rate (lowest available) since you were invited by a planner on the platform. Full membership benefits are listed here: {membership_link} 

Full membership gives unlimited outbound prospecting for new travel and event planner partnerships, waives commission on all earned bookings for a year. You will also have unlimited opportunities to submit proposals for matching itineraries that are trying to source new venues.

Hey {lead_first_name} - Happy to provide some additional context here on why the quote details must be sent / received through the portal.
 
Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this link: {nmqrurl}. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. 
  
Do you have any strategies already in place that help drive group bookings?

Best,
Taylor

User:
Dear Taylor,
  
 I hope this email finds you well.
  
 Unfortunately, I am not authorized to access to this portal and get a membership, therefore, I won’t be able to provide a proposal for you.
  
 I will remain attentive to any other request, and I will be glad to assist you directly via email.
 Kind regards / Saludos cordiales,

Assistant:
Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 

For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite.) As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration

 I hope this email finds you well.
  
 We do not use this platform to respond to RFP. Could you print the request to PDF and send it to me? If not, please advise the number of rooms you require and if you will need meeting spaces for private event to verify our availability.

Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.
 
There’s no cost to sign up, create your profile, connect to existing partners, and respond to this lead within Reposite using this link: {nmqrurl}. On our basic free plan, we charge a commission on all successful bookings. Through our Membership program, you receive matching inbound leads and group planner partnerships with all commissions and fees waived. 
  
Do you have any strategies already in place that help drive group bookings?

Best,

Totally understand, though as a heads up, this is definitely limiting your ability to work with B2B professional travel and event planners, who tend to send consistent, repeatable business to suppliers that they're able to work with easily. To put into perspective, sending requests and receiving responses via email generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!). 

For reference, our average group size that we see come through the platform is 72, so if this is the type of lead that you're looking to grow within the business, then the membership is a no brainer @ $500 for the year (our lowest available rate, since you were identified by a planner through Reposite.) As part of the membership, all commissions are waived, you get invited to networking events with some of the largest planners in the industry, and you instantly get added to the searchable supplier databases of the 2.1k+ planners within the Reposite network. 

My colleague Dan runs office hours / Q&A sessions twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration  

Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Best,
Taylor","Dear Tylor,
 

 We do not utilize this platform for responding to RFPs. Would you be able to convert the request to a PDF and forward it to me? If that's not feasible, kindly inform me about the number of rooms you need and whether you require meeting spaces for a private event, so we can check our availability.

 3- Then we will be set all in terms of booking after receiving the CC.
 4- Our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at thr PU time to conduct the run without any additional communication.
 Please let us know if it would be ok for you, but I assure you we wont subscribe for your services and pay for your services, you can add some commision onto our rates and make money of course.

Assistant:
Thanks for the breakdown. Seems like you have a system in place, but I do have to say that this is likely preventing you from receiving consistent group business from B2B professional travel and event planners. That model generally works well for B2C business, but most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).

Reposite helps travel agents, event planners, and tour operators discover new suppliers, organize all their trips & quotes, and build itineraries. When they plan trips, they’re able to research suppliers and request quotes. You were invited to Reposite from one of these quote requests. By replying through Reposite, they keep all relevant supplier quotes & replies in one place vs having it scattered across multiple emails, calls, documents.

If you have any interest in growing your business through these types of planners, I invite you to join one of our membership Q&A sessions. My teammate Dan runs them twice a week to answer any questions. Here are the links for Tuesdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIoce2upjsuHNwRrZ06ZQ-n0R3QmpL585nc#/registration and for Thursdays: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcu2qqz0jE9EswvqkJHpkEm_C6SvFd2dx#/registration  

Just let me know once you pick a date/time so I can give him a heads up.

Best,
Taylor","Hello,
 

 Our collaboration with other entities typically follows the process below:
 1- Please email us the trip details, and we’ll inform you of our availability.
 2- Should you wish to move forward, we'll enter the reservations, then send you confirmation emails and a CC form.
 3- Upon receiving the CC, all booking aspects will be finalized.
 4- Without necessitating additional communication, our driver and vehicle will be at the PU address at the PU time to conduct the run.
 

 Kindly confirm if this works for you. However, please be assured that we will not subscribe and pay for your services. You are, of course, welcome to add a commission to our rates to generate profit.
 Wishing you a pleasant day.

Totally understand your rationale on this. It's worth noting that our average group size for trips/events through Reposite is 72, and we've seen a lot of activity pick up in the {destination} area in the past few months. So membership is really only designed for providers who are wanting to learn how to build a more consistent pipeline of group business via B2B planners. Most professional travel and event planners won't engage directly (imagine having to submit forms and leave voicemails for every aspect of an itinerary - restaurants, activities, transportation, hotel, etc. on individual business websites!).
